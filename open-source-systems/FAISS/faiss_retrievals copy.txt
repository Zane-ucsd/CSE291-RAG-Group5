Content: Badminton, as a sport that demands speed, accuracy, and agility, often causes injuries to players. These injuries can reduce their quality of life and athletic careers. Therefore, effective and evidence-based injury rehabilitation is crucial for recovery and prevention of re-injury. This study aims to systematise the current evidence regarding injury rehabilitation methods in badminton and evaluate their effectiveness in supporting player well-being. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines; this study screened and analysed studies from Pub Med, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria included studies that evaluated injury rehabilitation programmes specifically for badminton players, with outcome measures of functional recovery, pain reduction, and prevention of re-injury. Quality assessment was conducted using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) tool, and data were extracted for thematic analysis. The results showed that a combination of physical therapy, strengthening exercises, and manual intervention techniques such as joint mobilisation and manipulation provided the most effective outcomes in injury rehabilitation. There is strong evidence supporting the use of proprioceptive training to prevent re-injury. Factors such as player age, initial injury severity, and adherence to the rehabilitation programme were shown to influence recovery success. This study concludes that the approach to injury rehabilitation in badminton should be multidisciplinary, integrating various physiotherapy techniques for optimal outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of a tailored and evidence-based rehabilitation programme in supporting athletes' recovery and preventing possible future injuries. This study also suggests the need for further research to develop specific and standardised rehabilitation guidelines for badminton players.

Content: In the sport process of badminton, players need to constantly change their positions according to the actual situation of the game to complete various combat actions, which brings a certain pressure to the athletes' knee joints, and it is easy to cause knee joint injuries. Therefore, this paper puts forward relevant recovery strategies for badminton players' knee injuries. The research results show that active restorative training has a good effect on the relief of knee joint pain and the improvement of stability of athletes, which is better than passive acupuncture and physiotherapy. Therefore, some targeted restorative training should be purposefully added to the knee joint rehabilitation of athletes, so that athletes can better recover their knee joints and return to the competition field.

Content: Badminton is considered as one of the fastest racket sports (Phomsoupha and Laffaye, 2015; Abdullahi and Coetzee, 2017; Gomez et al., 2021), requiring frequent quick starts, stops, lunges, and changes of direction (Shariff et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2014). These high-intensity and quick movements and reactions in badminton significantly increased the risks of injuries to lower extremities, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of knees, one type of injury that frequently occurs in badminton athletes (Kimura et al., 2012; Alikhani et al., 2019; Zhao and Gu, 2019). In addition, badminton matches require players to adjust their body position continuously throughout the game, in which their capacity of dynamic balance to maintain their center of gravity within the base of support to react to the moving shuttlecock (Faude et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2013). Strategies aiming to improve knee function and proprioception are thus beneficial for the on-court performance of badminton players and can help reduce the risk of injuries (White et al., 2013).

Content: Badminton, recognized as one of the most popular sports in the world, demands extreme speed, accuracy, and endurance from its players. Although it presents many health and fitness benefits, the intensity and physical requirements of the sport inherently increase the risk of injury for its athletes. According to a study by (Marchena-Rodriguez et al., 2020), the prevalence of injuries among competitive badminton players ranged from 2.9 to 9.5 injuries per 1000 hours played, with injuries to the ankle and knee being the most common. These findings highlight the importance of effective rehabilitation strategies for recovery and future injury prevention. Evidence-based approaches in injury rehabilitation have gained widespread recognition in the past decade as the best method in the management of sports injuries. This approach relies on empirical data from controlled studies to inform clinical practice, ensuring that patients receive the most effective interventions available. For example, (Thibaut et al., 2022) emphasized the importance of this approach in improving rehabilitation outcomes for shoulder injuries, proposing that clinical decisions should be based on current scientific evidence rather than on tradition or personal preference. However, despite advances in medical research and practice, there are still gaps in the application of evidence-based approaches specific to injury rehabilitation in badminton. This is due to variations in injury type, severity, and the individual athletes involved. According to (Malwanage et al., 2022), the unique dynamics and movements in badminton require an in-depth understanding of injury mechanisms and rehabilitation interventions specific to this sport. This suggests the need for more focused studies to understand how best to apply evidence-based rehabilitation principles in the badminton context.

Content: The findings of this systematic review pave the way for various future research directions that are important to develop and strengthen the evidence base in badminton injury rehabilitation. Firstly, longitudinal studies that evaluate the long-term effectiveness of evidence-based rehabilitation protocols are needed. This will provide insight into the durability of the intervention and its potential effect in preventing re-injury. Secondly, there is a need for more specific research on the most common injuries in badminton, such as knee and ankle injuries, with a focus on customised rehabilitation approaches for these injuries. In addition, future research could also explore the integration of new technologies, such as virtual reality and wearable technologies, in rehabilitation programmes. These technologies have the potential to increase player engagement in the rehabilitation process and allow for better monitoring of recovery. Finally, comparative studies between traditional and innovative rehabilitation approaches could provide additional evidence on the most effective methods for specific conditions. By exploring these areas, future research could make a significant contribution towards the development of more effective and efficient injury rehabilitation practices in badminton.

Content: According to the statistical data of Kimura et al. , 37% of all badminton injuries are knee ACL injuries. The literature primarily describes two ACL injury mechanisms for badminton players. The first one and most common one is landing on one lower extremity after hitting the shuttlecock above the head. This affects the lower extremity on the opposite side of the dominant upper extremity (the one holding the racquet). The other mechanism involves a backward lunge and a side lunge. In this case, it is the lower extremity on the side of the dominant upper extremity that is injured . A recommended method to minimise these risk factors is proper education and teaching related to the basics of motor training . Early detection of potentially reduced knee stability could make it possible to launch a programme of preventive actions to minimize the risk of knee instability and of complete damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The purpose of this study was to define the impact of playing badminton on the anterior stability of the knee, measured by arthrometer. An additional purpose was to assess subjects using the full functional movement screen (FMS) protocol. The results of this study may be significant in the professional work of badminton coaches, orthopaedists, physical therapists, and motor training coaches.

Content: To our knowledge, no comprehensive guidelines exist for preventing lower limb injuries in badminton. It was identified several effective preventive strategies, including biomechanical evaluations, which reduced the injury rate from 20.0% to 18.0%; customized warm-up routines, which lowered the rate from 34.5% to 20.0%; and recuperation management, such as ensuring adequate rest and therapy, which decreased the rate from 32.0% to 19.0% . Safe lunge-landing biomechanics include several key elements. Proper foot positioning, where the foot lands flat or on the forefoot , helps reduce impact forces on the joints. Controlled ankle inversion is crucial to minimize excessive inward rotation and prevent ankle sprains . Maintaining good knee flexion and alignment ensures that the knee aligns with the toes, reducing strain on the knee ligaments, particularly the ACL. Adequate hip flexion helps absorb landing forces, thereby reducing the load on the knee and ankle joints. Additionally,

Content: Knee joint injury is one of the common injuries in badminton. There are many researches at home and abroad, and the importance of knee joint injury is getting higher and higher. Incorrect badminton movement techniques, excessive sports and incorrect sports hygiene habits can all cause different degrees of injuries. In sports training, attention should be paid to the arrangement of content and load according to physical characteristics, training level and training period. Ideological education for athletes should also be strengthened to establish a correct outlook on life and world outlook. Before training or exercise, the knee joint should be well prepared, and vigorous energy should be maintained during exercise. When physical strength decreases and body fatigue occurs, great exercise should be avoided as much as possible to prevent injury. Improving the ability of knee joint becomes an indispensable part of badminton. At the same time, to master the correct technology of badminton and do a good job of special preparation is a problem worthy of attention in this mass sports activity. On the basis of not affecting the action sensitivity, properly increase the anti twist performance of the forefoot of the badminton shoes, reduce the turnover of the forefoot, so as to reduce the load moving to the inside. Before training or exercise, the knee joint should be well prepared for exercise. During exercise, keep vigorous energy. When the physical strength drops and the body is tired, try to avoid large exercise to prevent injury.

Content: This study provides valuable insights into injury rehabilitation approaches in badminton, emphasising evidence-based principles. Compared to previous studies, this systematic review highlights the importance of integrating findings from various disciplines, including sports medicine, physiotherapy and sports psychology, to build a holistic rehabilitation strategy. For example, a study by (Feng &amp; Wang, 2023) focused on the physical aspects of rehabilitation. In contrast, the researchers' findings suggested that psychological recovery also plays an important role in player well-being. Furthermore, a study by (Shi &amp; Han, 2022), which used a quantitative approach in assessing the effectiveness of specific exercises, contributed to the evidence in favour of several rehabilitation techniques. However, the researcher's review added to the literature by highlighting the need for a more individualised approach, acknowledging the variation in injury and recovery responses between players. The alignments and differences with this study suggest that while there is consensus on some basic principles of rehabilitation, its practical application requires a broader consideration of players' specific needs and conditions. This underlines the importance of ongoing research to optimise injury rehabilitation strategies in badminton with an approach that is evidence-based and considers multidisciplinary aspects.

Content: Common Approaches in Rehabilitation: A Review of Principles Injury rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of an athlete's recovery after injury, especially in intense sports such as badminton. The approach involves a series of steps designed to ensure effective and efficient recovery, reduce the risk of re-injury, and allow players to return to their peak performance. The basic principles of injury rehabilitation include rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE), followed by physical therapy and strengthening exercises aimed at restoring function, strength and mobility of the injured area ( Sara Horvat , 2024). Rest is the initial and perhaps most important step in the rehabilitation process. It not only refers to the cessation of the activity that caused the injury but also includes activity modification to avoid stressing the injured area. The application of ice immediately after the injury occurs can help reduce inflammation and pain, while compression and elevation contribute to the reduction of swelling (Kwiecien, 2023). After the initial phase of recovery, physical therapy plays an important role in injury rehabilitation. It involves a series of exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility and stability without overloading the injured area. The physical therapy approach should be individualised, considering the type of injury and the specific needs of the player (Carreno et al., 2021). Strengthening exercises are another important component of injury rehabilitation. It not only focuses on the injured area but also on strengthening the surrounding muscles and support structures to prevent re-injury. Research has shown that a structured exercise programme can significantly reduce the risk of re-injury and improve athletic performance (Dijksma et al., 2020).

Content: Types of Injuries: Injuries in badminton are common due to the high intensity and repetitive movements demanded by the sport. The most common injuries include ankle sprain, knee, shoulder, and back injuries, which can vary from acute injuries like sprains to chronic injuries like tendinitis. The sport requires a combination of speed, strength, and flexibility, which places great stress on various muscle groups and joints, especially when movements are performed with incorrect technique or inadequate equipment (Bertrando, 2018). An ankle sprain is one of the most commonly reported injuries, often resulting from improper landing after a jump or sudden movement to change direction. An epidemiological study by (Wang, 2023) found that these injuries are highly prevalent among badminton players, highlighting the importance of prevention through adequate warm-up and the use of proper footwear. Knee injuries, including sprained ligaments and meniscus damage, are also common, as shown by a study conducted by (Weber et al., 2020) which highlights how repetitive motion and overloading of the knee can lead to serious injuries. In addition, shoulder injuries are often experienced by badminton players due to repetitive overhead movements, such as smashes and serves, which can lead to overuse injuries such as rotator cuff tendinitis. Studies by (Zhou et al., 2022) have identified that these repetitive movements without adequate rest can increase the risk of shoulder injuries. Back injuries are also a concern, especially among players who perform a lot of smashes and serves, where excessive rotation and extension of the spine can lead to injury. Research (Dutta &amp; SV, 2021) suggests that improper practice and technique can cause undue stress on the back, triggering or exacerbating injuries.

Content: 389 ever, it orthoses that established been yet prevent not has - Achilles tendinopathy or achillodynia . 390 Most anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur during sports activity (Table 5). According to existing research, up to 70% of all incidents are non-contact injuries , whilst ACL injuries account for 37% of all injuries requiring surgically treatment . The greater activation of the knee extensor is a predictor of knee injury, because of increased tension on the ACL . Players need to move from back to front and side to side rapidly; they also need to return to the center of the court to prepare for the next shot by performing footwork that is unique to badminton . The injury patterns recorded appear to be the result of frequently performed movements. In badminton, ACL injuries were found to be the result of two injury mechanisms (Table 5). First, the knee opposite the racket-hand side is at risk of injury during a singleleg landing after an overhead stroke. This usually occurs in the backhand side of the court (48%) . The knee of the racket hand side is susceptible to injury because of plant-and-cut movements during side or backward stepping in the forehand side of the court (38%). ACL injury can also be explained by a greater increase in the knee valgus angle and movement during single-leg landing following back-steps to the backhand-side rear than with back-steps to the forehand-side rear .

Content: - Studies that have reported on eye injuries have determined 460 - the nature of these injuries and the way they occur. They 461 - have also suggested possible preventive measures. The main 462 - reason for eye injury is shuttlecock impact from an oppo463 - nent's stroke; thus, by wearing glasses, badminton players 464 can considerably reduce the risk of eye injury. Injuries to the arm and shoulder in badminton are largely due to faulty technique, while leg and back injuries are caused mainly by a lack of strength or mobility. The contribution of the trunk to the prevention of lower limb injuries suggests that specific attention should be paid to this area. In general, the patellar tendon is put under serious stress in badminton . Studies have shown that a substantial number of elite badminton players have patellar tendon pain and 'jumper's knee' . Male badminton players have a significantly higher incidence of painful patellar tendons . Rapid changes in the direction of movement, jumps and lunges can all result in injuries to the Achilles tendon and anterior cruciate ligament. Tendons are put under high pressure during each movement and, in general, injuries occur at the end of a training session or tournament. Fatigue influences the way that lunges are performed and the way that the jump is received by making these tendons less powerful and more unstable. Such knowledge could help coaches and fitness trainers focus on the specific muscular activities required to prevent injuries. For example, they could design a training program that increases body strength to prevent injuries to badminton players. The relationship between coaches and scientists, particularly in terms of biomechanics and physiotherapy, will help improve performance and prevent injury.

Content: Figure 1. Knee joint injuries of badminton players. <!-- image --> Figure 2. Technical reasons of badminton players' knee joint injuries. <!-- image --> As shown in Figure 2, when the athletes have knee joint injuries, they are in the action. It can be seen from the data that among the 64 players, 3 players were injured during forehand serve, accounting for 4.69%; 27 athletes were injured in the killing process, accounting for 42.19%; 16 athletes were injured during footwork practice, accounting for 25.00%; 13 athletes were injured in the process of catching skill practice, accounting for 20.31%; There were 3 players injured in the process of drawing skill practice, accounting for 4.69%; In other cases, 2 athletes were injured, accounting for 3.13%. This shows that the knee joint injuries of athletes often occur when they perform some more intense or unfamiliar movements. Through the interview with these athletes, it can be found that when the competition or training is in a more intense stage, many athletes tend to be too excited and neglect their own safety protection, which is easy to cause some strains and sprains. There are also some athletes who are eager for success if they do not master footwork fluently in the learning and training of footwork, which leads to knee joint injuries. This shows that when playing badminton, we should pay attention to laying a good foundation and playing steadily. We should always pay attention to our own situation on the court to prevent sports injuries.

Content: Received: 07 Aug. 2024 Accepted: 13 Jan. 2025 Badminton is a popular sport with numerous health benefits but carries the risk of injury. Limited research is available on badminton-related injuries among senior Asian players. This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire to gather data on demographics, exercise habits, injury history, injury mechanisms, affected body parts, symptoms, and injury severity from 254 participants. Most participants were male (70.6%), with a median age of 46 years (inter-quartile range [IQR] = 16.0). The median injury incidence was 4.3 per 1,000 hours played (IQR = 6.5). The most commonly injured body parts on the dominant side were the knees (51.1%), ankles (36.3%), and shoulders/clavicles (25.5%). On the non-dominant side, the knee (34.2%) and ankle (25.5%) were frequently injured. The most common mechanism of knee and ankle injuries occurs during changes in direction. Common injuries included ankle sprains (23.5%), patellar tendinopathy (20.3%), and muscle cramps (31.6%). Most injuries (60.6%) were mild. Future studies should focus on comprehensive prevention methods to reduce injuries. Keywords: badminton, athletic injuries, knee injuries, ankle injuries, elderly, musculoskeletal diseases

Content: These injuries not only diminish the performance of elite athletes but also adversely affect the sustained engagement of the general public in badminton. This can culminate in a decline in sports participation. While the post-injury rehabilitation phase is important to ensure continued participation and performance in badminton, it is the prevention of injuries before rehabilitation that is crucial. To do this, it is important to recognize and manage the site, tissue, and cause of injuries in amateur badminton players. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore sports injuries among amateur badminton players involved in recreational activities. The findings aim to provide a foundation for developing effective injury prevention and training programs.

Content: The most frequently injured body tissues during both competition and training are muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Hy et al. examined 2620 badminton players with an average age of 31 years and reported that the most common injuries were sprains (56%), Achilles tendon ruptures (13%), and ankle ligament ruptures (23.2%) . Guermont et al. studied elite badminton players and found that musculotendinous injuries were the most prevalent, accounting for 51.4% of injuries . Among Swedish players, ligament sprains are the predominant knee injury, whereas patellar tendinopathy is more common among Malaysian players . Badminton is characterized by high-intensity activity punctuated by brief rest periods, demanding rapid movements and agile footwork. This regimen of repetitive motions significantly stresses both upper and lower limbs, elevating the risk of both acute and chronic injuries of various severities . The lower extremity musculature plays a crucial role, as it frequently executes fast, powerful movements using body weight during gameplay . Such repetitive actions lead to muscle and joint fatigue and increased laxity in the musculoskeletal system, which includes muscles, tendons, and ligaments, thereby heightening the risk of injury . The findings of this study, along with previous research, indicate that muscles, ligaments, and tendons are the tissues most commonly injured in amateur badminton players, underscoring the need for a systematic and scientifically based injury prevention program that focuses on strengthening these peripheral muscles and enhancing stability.

Content: Badminton involves singles and doubles matches characterized by jumps, lunges, rapid directional changes, and swift arm movements, which frequently lead to injuries across various body parts . Once injured, players often find it challenging to return to the sport and are at a high risk of recurrent injuries if they do not take adequate precautions . Research indicates that during competitions, injuries are most prevalent at the waist, followed by the ankle, knees, and shoulders, whereas during training, the back, knees, and shoulders are most affected. Studies of elite badminton players have highlighted that injuries to the lower limbs are most common during international competitions, followed by injuries to the feet and upper limbs . At the European Senior Championships, injuries were predominantly reported in the knees, legs, and shoulders of participants . The average age of the 469 badminton players studied was 19.2 years, ranging from 13 to 52 years; about 60% of the injuries occurred in players under 20 years of age, with the knees being particularly vulnerable . Consistent with prior findings, this study found that the knees and ankles of the lower limbs and the shoulders and waist of the upper limbs were most susceptible to injury. Ankle and knee injuries, particularly common in players who frequently jump, often involve ankle sprains during plantar-flexed and inverted movements, primarily during landing or turning . Moreover, non-contact injuries were also noted, occurring through improper movements and sliding. While singles players experience injuries primarily from non-contact mechanisms, doubles players sustain more injuries through interactions with other players than from any external contacts.

Content: Badminton is a sport that can cause injuries, although most are not caused by body-to-body contact [6, 21]. This may result in increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in older populations . Understanding the incidence and mechanisms of injuries can be beneficial for planning injury prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on badminton-related injuries, particularly among Asian senior players. Our findings demonstrated that approximately 77% of the participants had experienced badminton-related injuries in the past year. The incidence of injuries was approximately 4 injuries per 1,000 hours played. The most commonly affected body parts were the knee and ankle, regardless of the dominant or nondominant side. The mechanism of these injuries is associated with changing direction while playing. Forehand smashes are the most common badminton shots that cause injuries. However, most injuries were classified as minor and required less than one week for recovery. Common pain management methods include massage, oral analgesics, and physical rehabilitation.

Content: Badminton is a non-contact individual sport generally regarded as very safe since it doesn't involve direct physical interaction with other players. However, the quick direction changes, jumps, lunges at the net, and fast arm movements needed to hit the shuttlecock from various postures can raise the risk of injury. Research has shown that taking part in badminton training and tournaments increases the likelihood of injury by 15 to 39%. Interestingly, the injury rate is higher during training than in competition. In this context, physiotherapy plays a crucial role in treating such sports injuries. Sports physiotherapy, in particular, offers specialized rehabilitation programs designed for athletes recovering from injuries. These tailored treatments help athletes regain their strength and return to their sport in optimal condition. Need Help? Chat with us

Abstract: This study aims to examine sports injuries among amateur badminton players engaged in recreational activities, establishing a foundation for developing effective injury prevention and training programs. We assessed 504 amateur badminton players (302 males, 202 females) competing in the 2023 National Badminton Tournament in South Korea. This study focused on players involved in doubles matches, omitting singles competitors. Participants were divided into categories based on competitive and training sessions to document the location and type of injuries sustained. During competitions, the most frequently injured body parts were the waist (11.92%), ankle (11.66%), and knees and shoulders (11.53% each). In training sessions, injuries primarily affected the back and knees (12.43%) and shoulders (12.21%). The most common types of injuries during competitions were to muscles (35.60%), ligaments (29.32%), and tendons (12.04%), and during training to muscles (39.91%), ligaments (26.68%), and tendons (13.23%). Injuries resulting from player-to-player contact represented 19.44% of cases, while those involving non-player elements such as facility equipment accounted for 16.47%. There is a critical need to develop targeted injury prevention programs for amateur badminton players to mitigate injuries and enhance performance, thereby helping prevent the progression to chronic injury stages.

Content: According to our findings, the knees and ankles are the most commonly affected body parts, particularly when changing direction during play. This emphasizes the importance of high-quality footwork in badminton [29, 30]. Effective badminton footwork relies on several key factors including strength, agility, flexibility, balance, coordination, and reaction time [31, 32]. All major leg muscles, including the gluteus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius, are involved in badminton footwork, particularly the lunge and landing techniques . This may explain the prevalent involvement of these two joints in common injuries as they are directly associated with the aforementioned muscles. While lunges are a fundamental movement and an essential skill in badminton that enhances court coverage and shot execution [34, 35], they carry the risk of lower limb injuries because of the complexity of executing an effective lunge . Lunging generates significant vertical and horizontal forces, leading to high joint torque, especially at the knee. These forces are especially pronounced during extreme lunges and can contribute to injuries, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and patellar tendinosis [34, 37].

Therefore, the rehabilitation training for lumbar spine has always been a major focus of badminton injury rehabilitation research. This paper discusses the rehabilitation effect of Badminton Athletes' sports injury by means of inter group control. (Table 2) shows the range of motion of badminton players before and after rehabilitation training. It can be seen from Table 2 that the lumbar flexion of the experimental group changed from (86.626 3.163) before training to (90.009 1.178) after training, the lumbar extension changed from (26.573 1.171) before training to (29.859 1.388) after training, and the left lumbar flexion changed from (26.228 1.856) before training to (29.273 1.075) after training, The right lumbar flexion changed from (25.936 1.827) before training to (30.036 1.400) after training (P &lt; 0.01), indicating that there was a very significant difference.

Lower body injuries occurred most frequently (41%-92%), including strains (11%-64%), sprains (10%-61%), tendinopathy (6%-14%) and stress fractures (5%-11%). There was a high proportion of overuse injuries (25%-74%) and a predominance of mild and moderate injuries (73%-100%). The following risk factors can only be cautiously emphasised due to the heterogeneous results: The risk of injury increases with increasing level of play and a history of injury. Conclusion Young players with a history of injury quickly moving to higher competition classes must be targeted with the highest injury prevention priority. Future studies should focus on improving the quality of studies by using comparable data collection methods.

Content: <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 1. Proper Warm-Up and Cool-Down : One of the most neglected but important badminton injury prevention advice is warming up correctly ahead of a match or practice session. This enhances blood supply, improves flexibility, and readies the muscles for high-intensity action. 2. Warm-up : 10-15 minutes of easy cardio, dynamic stretching, arm circles, and lunges. 3. Cool-down : Gentle running followed by static stretching to unwind the muscles. 2. Strength and Conditioning : Conditioning your body, particularly the core, knees, shoulders, and ankles, is essential in preventing injury in badminton. 5. Strengthening exercises such as squats, lunges, planks, and shoulder presses should be prioritized. 6. Include resistance band exercises for joints and smaller stabilizer muscles. 3. Mastering Proper Technique : A large proportion of injuries are caused by technique or form. Your grip, footwork, or shot technique-whichever it is-can be corrected by an experienced coach to minimize the chance of strain. 8. Do not overextend when smashing. 9. Maintain proper lunge technique to prevent knee stress. 10. Apply wrist and shoulder strength correctly on shots. 4. Use Appropriate Footwear : Shoes for badminton are made with lateral support, traction, and cushioning to shock-absorb and stabilize. Worn or ill-fitting shoes substantially elevate the risk of injury. 12. Replace shoes when soles become worn or after 70-100 hours of use. 13. Skip running shoes as they do not have the lateral support badminton requires. 5. Hydration and Nutrition : A healthy and well-fed body recovers quicker and works better. Dehydration may cause muscle cramping and poor concentration, leading to accidents. 15. Drink water prior to, during, and after play. 16. Add foods that are high in protein, calcium, and magnesium for muscle and bone strength.

Content: On the other hand, the use of recent technologies, such as biofeedback and virtual reality, has shown potential in improving rehabilitation outcomes through increased motivation and better monitoring of player progress. The study (Song &amp; Tuo, 2022) highlights how these technologies can be used to individually tailor rehabilitation programmes, speed up recovery, and potentially reduce the risk of reinjury. Finally, it is important to note that an evidence-based approach in injury rehabilitation requires continuous updating of knowledge. Practitioners must continuously review current literature to ensure that their practice is in line with the latest and most robust evidence. This includes participation in continuing education and professional networks that enable the exchange of knowledge and experience (Negrini et al., 2022). An evidence-based approach in badminton injury rehabilitation offers a solid framework for developing effective interventions, improving recovery, and minimising the risk of future injury. By adopting this approach, practitioners can provide the best possible care for athletes based on current scientific evidence.

Content: Badminton has now become a popular sport in our country and is deeply loved by the masses. With the continuous popularization and improvement of badminton, knee joint injury has also become a psychological obstacle to badminton lovers to play their technical level . Badminton is one of the traditional sports in our country, which integrates athletics, fun, fitness and entertainment. It can enhance the functions of human circulation, respiration and other systems, and improve the body's speed, strength, endurance, flexibility, sensitivity, coordination and other qualities. From the perspective of athletic footwork, badminton players' lower limb movements on the court include sudden stop, quick rise, return movement, take-off and so on . Most of them involve the basic movements of the lower limbs. Therefore, what kind of reasonable joint angle, speed and appropriate relative position of links to push the ground will be directly related to badminton performance. Badminton belongs to the skill-oriented type of net-separated competitive event group, which has the characteristics of intense antagonism, high intensity of sports and no time limit for competitions . The ability of human body joints to bear load is limited. When an action exceeds the limit that the body can bear, the body will suffer various acute or chronic injuries . If not handled properly, it will limit the fitness ability of the bodybuilder and have a huge impact on the work and life of the bodybuilder.

Content: 1. Ankle Sprains : One of the most prevalent badminton injuries, ankle sprains are caused by sudden direction changes or landing awkwardly after a jump. Players tend to twist their ankles, leading to swelling, pain, and decreased mobility. 2. Cause : Sudden lateral movements, uneven ground, or unstable stabilizing muscles. 3. Recovery time: Minor sprains take only a few days, while bad ones could require weeks of rest and physiotherapy. 2. Shoulder Injuries (Rotator Cuff Strain): Badminton requires strong overhead strokes such as smashes and clears, which place continuous stress on the shoulder joint. Rotator cuff injury can be caused by overuse or bad technique. 5. Cause : Prolonged overhead action, poor posture, or insufficiency of shoulder conditioning. 6. Recovery time : Ranges from a few days of rest to a few weeks of physical therapy. 3. Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis): Notwithstanding its nomenclature, tennis elbow occurs frequently in badminton players. The injury is characterized by inflammation of tendons that connect the forearm muscles to the lateral aspect of the elbow. 8. Cause : Repetitive gripping or faulty handling of the racket. 9. Recovery period : 6 weeks to several months, depending on extent of injury. 4. Knee Injuries (Patellar Tendonitis &amp; ACL Strains): The jumping, sharp stops, and lunges of badminton are tough on the knees. Jumper's knee (patellar tendonitis) and strains to the ACL are common injuries, particularly when the knees aren't supported and warmed up appropriately. 11. Cause : Overuse, abrupt impact, or improper landing technique. 12. Recovery time : Several weeks to months, with potential medical care. 5. Wrist Strain : Because the wrist has to be flicked in order to deliver accurate badminton shots, it is common for players to suffer from wrist pain or tendinitis. 14. Cause : Overuse, excessive grip, or insufficient warm-up. 15. Recovery time: 1 to 2 weeks of rest and supportive bracing.

Content: The first hypothesis in this study, that regular badminton practice reduces the anterior stability of the knee joints in badminton players between the ages of 10 and 11, was not confirmed. During the period of our research, the group of subjects did not experience any trauma causing damage to the ACL and the stability of the knee joints did not decrease in the subjects. It can even be observed that practicing badminton on a regular basis in the training macrocycle increased the frontal stability in the group of subjects. When analyzing the results of the stability index, there is a significant difference in the experimental group ( p &lt; 0.05) between the first and second tests, which shows the positive effect of the badminton training on the anterior stability of the knee joint. It is significant that such a situation was not observed in the control group. Based on the literature review, it can be presumed that improved stability of the knee joints is most likely due to the improvement of the neuromuscular control of the trunk and lower limbs as a result of regular badminton training . There is a strong correlation between extensors, abductors and external rotators of the femur and the injuries of the ACL. Researchers claim that disturbed work of these muscles can cause valgus of

Content: Previous research, including our study, has established that injuries in badminton players typically occur in both the upper and lower extremities. In the upper extremities, the most frequently affected areas are the shoulders and the lower back, whereas the knees and ankles are the predominant injury sites in the lower extremities, with ligament sprains and muscle injuries being the most common types of tissue damage. Given the nature of badminton, which demands high-intensity actions such as jumping, landing, rapid directional changes, and high-impact movements, there is a compelling need for injury prevention training to mitigate the risk of injuries. Consequently, developing an injury prevention program for amateur badminton players is essential to prevent injuries and enhance performance, preventing the progression to chronic injuries.

Content: Ahigh rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury occurs during sports activity; about 70% of all ACL tears happens in noncontact mechanisms . The most common circumstances of contactless injuries are landing after a jump or a sudden change in the direction of movement with the foot stabilised on the ground . Sources also describe the activity of shearing forces as the body comes to a halt while the position of the joint is close to full extension . A number of ACL injury risk factors are mentioned and can be divided into anatomic and structural, genetic, hormonal, neuromuscular, biomechanical, and environmental . Exploring these interdependencies is particularly important for the process of planning and completing a rehabilitation programme, whether it is to prepare the patient for an ACL reconstruction, help them recover after surgery, or prevent an injury . As Kimura et al. and Kurihara et al. show in their study, the knee injury risk factors described in the literature are present in badminton . Motor system injuries in badminton constitute 5% of all sports injuries. Damage to the soft tissues of the lower extremities, usually connected with exertion, is the main cause of injuries in badminton . Badminton is an individual and non-contact sport characterised by jumps, quick changes in the direction of movement, sudden, powerful, energetic movements of the dominant upper extremity in various planes as well as forward, backward and side lunges . <!-- image --> Citation: Kubasik, W.; Rodak, P.; Przednowek, K.; Kluczniok, K.; Ficek, K.

The <!-- image --> range of injury incidence estimates reported in previous reviews is wide, even within the elite- player segment. 8 The epidemiological uncertainty in badminton is further challenged by methodological heterogeneity and differences in performance levels, study quality, sex and age groups. 8 Both acute and overuse injuries are caused by typical repetitive movement patterns, such as lunges, jumps, quick direction changes and overhead strokes, as these movements exert high stress on both the lower and upper extremities. 8 Injuries rarely occur due to collisions with the doubles partner's racket or the double partner themselves. 8 Eye injuries occur more commonly in racket sports and have been the subject of many studies. 9 While there is a considerable body of work on injury epidemiology in badminton, the heterogeneity and amount of previous work precluded a meta- analytical work.

It was identified several effective preventive strategies, including biomechanical evaluations, which reduced the injury rate from 20.0% to 18.0%; customized warm-up routines, which lowered the rate from 34.5% to 20.0%; and recuperation management, such as ensuring adequate rest and therapy, which decreased the rate from 32.0% to 19.0% . Safe lunge-landing biomechanics include several key elements. Proper foot positioning, where the foot lands flat or on the forefoot , helps reduce impact forces on the joints. Controlled ankle inversion is crucial to minimize excessive inward rotation and prevent ankle sprains . Maintaining good knee flexion and alignment ensures that the knee aligns with the toes, reducing strain on the knee ligaments, particularly the ACL.

The contribution of the trunk to the prevention of lower limb injuries suggests that specific attention should be paid to this area. In general, the patellar tendon is put under serious stress in badminton . Studies have shown that a substantial number of elite badminton players have patellar tendon pain and 'jumper's knee' . Male badminton players have a significantly higher incidence of painful patellar tendons . Rapid changes in the direction of movement, jumps and lunges can all result in injuries to the Achilles tendon and anterior cruciate ligament. Tendons are put under high pressure during each movement and, in general, injuries occur at the end of a training session or tournament. Fatigue influences the way that lunges are performed and the way that the jump is received by making these tendons less powerful and more unstable. Such knowledge could help coaches and fitness trainers focus on the specific muscular activities required to prevent injuries. For example, they could design a training program that increases body strength to prevent injuries to badminton players. The relationship between coaches and scientists, particularly in terms of biomechanics and physiotherapy, will help improve performance and prevent injury.

Content: Badminton is a sport that can cause injuries, although most are not caused by body-to-body contact [6, 21]. This may result in increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in older populations . Understanding the incidence and mechanisms of injuries can be beneficial for planning injury prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on badminton-related injuries, particularly among Asian senior players. Our findings demonstrated that approximately 77% of the participants had experienced badminton-related injuries in the past year. The incidence of injuries was approximately 4 injuries per 1,000 hours played. The most commonly affected body parts were the knee and ankle, regardless of the dominant or nondominant side. The mechanism of these injuries is associated with changing direction while playing. Forehand smashes are the most common badminton shots that cause injuries. However, most injuries were classified as minor and required less than one week for recovery. Common pain management methods include massage, oral analgesics, and physical rehabilitation.

Content: Previous research, including our study, has established that injuries in badminton players typically occur in both the upper and lower extremities. In the upper extremities, the most frequently affected areas are the shoulders and the lower back, whereas the knees and ankles are the predominant injury sites in the lower extremities, with ligament sprains and muscle injuries being the most common types of tissue damage. Given the nature of badminton, which demands high-intensity actions such as jumping, landing, rapid directional changes, and high-impact movements, there is a compelling need for injury prevention training to mitigate the risk of injuries. Consequently, developing an injury prevention program for amateur badminton players is essential to prevent injuries and enhance performance, preventing the progression to chronic injuries.

Content: Badminton, recognized as one of the most popular sports in the world, demands extreme speed, accuracy, and endurance from its players. Although it presents many health and fitness benefits, the intensity and physical requirements of the sport inherently increase the risk of injury for its athletes. According to a study by (Marchena-Rodriguez et al., 2020), the prevalence of injuries among competitive badminton players ranged from 2.9 to 9.5 injuries per 1000 hours played, with injuries to the ankle and knee being the most common. These findings highlight the importance of effective rehabilitation strategies for recovery and future injury prevention. Evidence-based approaches in injury rehabilitation have gained widespread recognition in the past decade as the best method in the management of sports injuries. This approach relies on empirical data from controlled studies to inform clinical practice, ensuring that patients receive the most effective interventions available. For example, (Thibaut et al., 2022) emphasized the importance of this approach in improving rehabilitation outcomes for shoulder injuries, proposing that clinical decisions should be based on current scientific evidence rather than on tradition or personal preference. However, despite advances in medical research and practice, there are still gaps in the application of evidence-based approaches specific to injury rehabilitation in badminton. This is due to variations in injury type, severity, and the individual athletes involved. According to (Malwanage et al., 2022), the unique dynamics and movements in badminton require an in-depth understanding of injury mechanisms and rehabilitation interventions specific to this sport. This suggests the need for more focused studies to understand how best to apply evidence-based rehabilitation principles in the badminton context.

This explain how the injury occurred and as well as medical and training recommendations for athletic population. News. -Badminton injuries are around 1-5% of all sports injuries. It ranked six after soccer, basketball, volleyball, long-distance running and cycling. Prospects and projects. -Such knowledge could help coaches and fitness trainers focus on the specific muscular activities required to prevent injuries. The relationship between scientists and coaches, particularly in terms of biomechanics and physiotherapy, will help improve performance and prevent injury. Conclusion. -Badminton will be influenced by the evolution of intensity of the game. It is apparent that the movement patterns and movement demands are related to an increase in injuries and the generation of new injuries. Eye injury occurs when shuttlecock impact from an opponent's stroke. Wearing glasses can considerably reduce the risk of eye injury. Injuries to the arm and shoulder are due to faulty technique, while leg and back injuries are caused mainly by a lack of strength or mobility. The contribution of the trunk to the prevention of lower limb injuries suggests that specific attention should be paid to this area. Fatigue influences the way that lunges are performed, and the jump is received by making these tendons less powerful and more unstable.

Content: It has been proven that badminton not only enhances physical health but also mental and social well-being across numerous age groups . However, similar to other sports, it is also associated with musculoskeletal injuries. Badminton injuries make up approximately 1-5% of all sports injuries. According to previous studies, the risk of injuries in badminton is approximately 0.9 injuries per annum and 1-7 injuries per 1,000 hours of play . The lower limb is the most commonly affected in such injuries, with an estimated 58-92% of cases involving it. The knee is the most commonly injured part of the lower limb, followed by the ankle, with common injuries including strains, sprains, tendinopathy, and stress fractures . However, with most injuries categorized as mild to moderate in terms of severity, at least 20% of schoolchildren missed at least one day of school in a given year due to sports injuries. Furthermore, it was estimated that one in three working adults lost at least one day per year because of injuries from sports-related activities . Therefore, comprehensive preventive strategies must be implemented to mitigate adverse outcomes. It was proposed a four-step model for injury prevention . This model begins with the critical step of establishing the magnitude of the injury, followed by identifying the etiology and mechanisms of the injury. Subsequently, it involves the introduction of preventive measures and evaluation of their effectiveness. Population aging is a phenomenon that affects many countries worldwide, including those in Asia . The population aged over 60 years increased from 5% in 1995 to 17.1% in 2017 and is projected to increase to 30% by 2035 . This demographic shift has led to an increase in the number of elderly patients with sportsrelated trauma, potentially increasing its morbidity and mortality

Content: Badminton, as a sport that demands speed, accuracy, and agility, often causes injuries to players. These injuries can reduce their quality of life and athletic careers. Therefore, effective and evidence-based injury rehabilitation is crucial for recovery and prevention of re-injury. This study aims to systematise the current evidence regarding injury rehabilitation methods in badminton and evaluate their effectiveness in supporting player well-being. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines; this study screened and analysed studies from Pub Med, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria included studies that evaluated injury rehabilitation programmes specifically for badminton players, with outcome measures of functional recovery, pain reduction, and prevention of re-injury. Quality assessment was conducted using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) tool, and data were extracted for thematic analysis. The results showed that a combination of physical therapy, strengthening exercises, and manual intervention techniques such as joint mobilisation and manipulation provided the most effective outcomes in injury rehabilitation. There is strong evidence supporting the use of proprioceptive training to prevent re-injury. Factors such as player age, initial injury severity, and adherence to the rehabilitation programme were shown to influence recovery success. This study concludes that the approach to injury rehabilitation in badminton should be multidisciplinary, integrating various physiotherapy techniques for optimal outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of a tailored and evidence-based rehabilitation programme in supporting athletes' recovery and preventing possible future injuries. This study also suggests the need for further research to develop specific and standardised rehabilitation guidelines for badminton players.

Proper Warm-Up and Cool-Down : One of the most neglected but important badminton injury prevention advice is warming up correctly ahead of a match or practice session. This enhances blood supply, improves flexibility, and readies the muscles for high-intensity action. 2. Warm-up : 10-15 minutes of easy cardio, dynamic stretching, arm circles, and lunges. 3. Cool-down : Gentle running followed by static stretching to unwind the muscles. 2. Strength and Conditioning : Conditioning your body, particularly the core, knees, shoulders, and ankles, is essential in preventing injury in badminton. 5. Strengthening exercises such as squats, lunges, planks, and shoulder presses should be prioritized. 6. Include resistance band exercises for joints and smaller stabilizer muscles. 3. Mastering Proper Technique : A large proportion of injuries are caused by technique or form. Your grip, footwork, or shot technique-whichever it is-can be corrected by an experienced coach to minimize the chance of strain. 8. Do not overextend when smashing. 9. Maintain proper lunge technique to prevent knee stress. 10. Apply wrist and shoulder strength correctly on shots. 4. Use Appropriate Footwear : Shoes for badminton are made with lateral support, traction, and cushioning to shock-absorb and stabilize. Worn or ill-fitting shoes substantially elevate the risk of injury. 12. Replace shoes when soles become worn or after 70-100 hours of use. 13. Skip running shoes as they do not have the lateral support badminton requires. 5. Hydration and Nutrition : A healthy and well-fed body recovers quicker and works better. Dehydration may cause muscle cramping and poor concentration, leading to accidents. 15. Drink water prior to, during, and after play. 16. Add foods that are high in protein, calcium, and magnesium for muscle and bone strength.

Content: Types of Injuries: Injuries in badminton are common due to the high intensity and repetitive movements demanded by the sport. The most common injuries include ankle sprain, knee, shoulder, and back injuries, which can vary from acute injuries like sprains to chronic injuries like tendinitis. The sport requires a combination of speed, strength, and flexibility, which places great stress on various muscle groups and joints, especially when movements are performed with incorrect technique or inadequate equipment (Bertrando, 2018). An ankle sprain is one of the most commonly reported injuries, often resulting from improper landing after a jump or sudden movement to change direction. An epidemiological study by (Wang, 2023) found that these injuries are highly prevalent among badminton players, highlighting the importance of prevention through adequate warm-up and the use of proper footwear. Knee injuries, including sprained ligaments and meniscus damage, are also common, as shown by a study conducted by (Weber et al., 2020) which highlights how repetitive motion and overloading of the knee can lead to serious injuries. In addition, shoulder injuries are often experienced by badminton players due to repetitive overhead movements, such as smashes and serves, which can lead to overuse injuries such as rotator cuff tendinitis. Studies by (Zhou et al., 2022) have identified that these repetitive movements without adequate rest can increase the risk of shoulder injuries. Back injuries are also a concern, especially among players who perform a lot of smashes and serves, where excessive rotation and extension of the spine can lead to injury. Research (Dutta &amp; SV, 2021) suggests that improper practice and technique can cause undue stress on the back, triggering or exacerbating injuries.

Content: Badminton involves singles and doubles matches characterized by jumps, lunges, rapid directional changes, and swift arm movements, which frequently lead to injuries across various body parts . Once injured, players often find it challenging to return to the sport and are at a high risk of recurrent injuries if they do not take adequate precautions . Research indicates that during competitions, injuries are most prevalent at the waist, followed by the ankle, knees, and shoulders, whereas during training, the back, knees, and shoulders are most affected. Studies of elite badminton players have highlighted that injuries to the lower limbs are most common during international competitions, followed by injuries to the feet and upper limbs . At the European Senior Championships, injuries were predominantly reported in the knees, legs, and shoulders of participants . The average age of the 469 badminton players studied was 19.2 years, ranging from 13 to 52 years; about 60% of the injuries occurred in players under 20 years of age, with the knees being particularly vulnerable . Consistent with prior findings, this study found that the knees and ankles of the lower limbs and the shoulders and waist of the upper limbs were most susceptible to injury. Ankle and knee injuries, particularly common in players who frequently jump, often involve ankle sprains during plantar-flexed and inverted movements, primarily during landing or turning . Moreover, non-contact injuries were also noted, occurring through improper movements and sliding. While singles players experience injuries primarily from non-contact mechanisms, doubles players sustain more injuries through interactions with other players than from any external contacts.

Content: Badminton is considered as one of the fastest racket sports (Phomsoupha and Laffaye, 2015; Abdullahi and Coetzee, 2017; Gomez et al., 2021), requiring frequent quick starts, stops, lunges, and changes of direction (Shariff et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2014). These high-intensity and quick movements and reactions in badminton significantly increased the risks of injuries to lower extremities, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of knees, one type of injury that frequently occurs in badminton athletes (Kimura et al., 2012; Alikhani et al., 2019; Zhao and Gu, 2019). In addition, badminton matches require players to adjust their body position continuously throughout the game, in which their capacity of dynamic balance to maintain their center of gravity within the base of support to react to the moving shuttlecock (Faude et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2013).

Content: Badminton is a non-contact individual sport generally regarded as very safe since it doesn't involve direct physical interaction with other players. However, the quick direction changes, jumps, lunges at the net, and fast arm movements needed to hit the shuttlecock from various postures can raise the risk of injury. Research has shown that taking part in badminton training and tournaments increases the likelihood of injury by 15 to 39%. Interestingly, the injury rate is higher during training than in competition. In this context, physiotherapy plays a crucial role in treating such sports injuries. Sports physiotherapy, in particular, offers specialized rehabilitation programs designed for athletes recovering from injuries. These tailored treatments help athletes regain their strength and return to their sport in optimal condition. Need Help? Chat with us

Hy et al. examined 2620 badminton players with an average age of 31 years and reported that the most common injuries were sprains (56%), Achilles tendon ruptures (13%), and ankle ligament ruptures (23.2%) . Guermont et al. studied elite badminton players and found that musculotendinous injuries were the most prevalent, accounting for 51.4% of injuries . Among Swedish players, ligament sprains are the predominant knee injury, whereas patellar tendinopathy is more common among Malaysian players . Badminton is characterized by high-intensity activity punctuated by brief rest periods, demanding rapid movements and agile footwork. This regimen of repetitive motions significantly stresses both upper and lower limbs, elevating the risk of both acute and chronic injuries of various severities . The lower extremity musculature plays a crucial role, as it frequently executes fast, powerful movements using body weight during gameplay . Such repetitive actions lead to muscle and joint fatigue and increased laxity in the musculoskeletal system, which includes muscles, tendons, and ligaments, thereby heightening the risk of injury . The findings of this study, along with previous research, indicate that muscles, ligaments, and tendons are the tissues most commonly injured in amateur badminton players, underscoring the need for a systematic and scientifically based injury prevention program that focuses on strengthening these peripheral muscles and enhancing stability.

Content: Badminton is an advantageous sport in China. Therefore, many badminton players have good sports skills, but because of their own advantages in badminton, many badminton players' awareness of sports injury prevention is not in place. For example, many athletes think they are very skilled in badminton, because in the process of sports, they may ignore the warm-up movement and start the relevant badminton movement after a few simple stretches, which can easily lead to the emergence of sports injuries. Some athletes are influenced by the dazzling videos on the Internet, such as 'rice spoon playing table tennis', and also choose inappropriate equipment for the demonstration of sports skills, which also increases the probability of sports injury to some extent. Therefore, in the process of badminton, it is necessary to strengthen the cultivation of sports injury prevention awareness. Whether it is serious training or simple skill display, it is necessary to do sufficient warm-up activities, wear and use formal equipment, and keep focused at all times, so as to prevent sports injury caused by self contempt and indifference.

First, as this was a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, participants may have had inaccurate recollections and misunderstandings, leading to inconsistent data. Additionally, lengthy questionnaires can cause participant fatigue and reduce response quality. Second, this study focused on the musculoskeletal injuries related to badminton. Patients with injuries to other organs, such as the eyes, were not included. Further research is necessary to identify the incidence and severity of these injuries and develop effective injury prevention plans. Third, although our study identified the knee and ankle as the most commonly affected body parts, particularly during direction changes in play, we recognize the need for more comprehensive preventive strategies against these injuries. We are optimistic that future studies focusing on comprehensive methods will help fill this knowledge gap and improve the prevention and minimization of badminton-related injuries.

Content: Adequate injury prevention programming based on epidemiological data, addressing injury characteristics and risk factors, is crucial for the sustainable and successful long- term development of (elite) athletes. Collecting epidemiological data is a crucial first part of 'prevention sequencing', described by van Mechelen et al 10 and updated and expanded by Finch 11 as the 'TRIPP framework'. This model comprises six consecutive steps: identifying the problem, analysing the causes, developing prevention strategies, testing the prevention strategies, putting the prevention strategies into practice and evaluating the implementation. The Translating Research into Injury Prevention Practice (TRIPP) framework particularly emphasises implementing and evaluating prevention strategies in the real world. Based on this cycle and with the aim of injury prevention in badminton, this review analyses the first two pillars of injury prevention according to Finch based on the existing literature. Therefore, sound epidemiological data on the frequency and characteristics of injuries in badminton, such as mechanism, location and type, as well as severity, are important prerequisites for developing, assessing and implementing effective injury prevention programs. 10 Against this background, this systematic review aims to analyse and summarise available epidemiological data on badminton injuries to arrive at comprehensive conclusions, including possible high- risk constellations and valid considerations for developing injury prevention programmes and the direction of future research in injury programme implementation.

Limited research is available on badminton-related injuries among senior Asian players. This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire to gather data on demographics, exercise habits, injury history, injury mechanisms, affected body parts, symptoms, and injury severity from 254 participants. Most participants were male (70.6%), with a median age of 46 years (inter-quartile range [IQR] = 16.0). The median injury incidence was 4.3 per 1,000 hours played (IQR = 6.5). The most commonly injured body parts on the dominant side were the knees (51.1%), ankles (36.3%), and shoulders/clavicles (25.5%). On the non-dominant side, the knee (34.2%) and ankle (25.5%) were frequently injured. The most common mechanism of knee and ankle injuries occurs during changes in direction.

Content: The epidemiology of badminton injuries is not well documented and there is a lack of data in Thailand, particularly among senior players, given the country ' s aging population [20, 22]. It was analyzed 44 badminton athletes in Hong Kong . The overall incidence of injuries was 5.04 per 1,000 player hours. The highest incidence was among elite senior athletes (7.38), followed by elite junior athletes (5.03), and potential athletes (2.07). Elite senior athletes had a higher incidence of recurrent injuries, whereas elite junior athletes and potential athletes had higher incidences of new injuries. Most new injuries were strains (n = 80), with the most frequently injured body sites being the back (21.3%), shoulder (18.8%), thigh (18.8%), and knees (18.8%). It was conducted a retrospective case review in Malaysia . Over a period of 2.5 years, a total of 469 musculoskeletal injuries were diagnosed. Of these, 276 (58.8%) injuries occurred in badminton players aged &lt; 20 years old. The majority of injuries, 406 (86.6%) occurred during training or practice sessions, while only eight (1.7%) occurred during competitions. Overuse injuries were the most common type of injuries diagnosed at NSI clinics. In terms of injury severity, 429 (91.5%) were mild, 7 (1.5%) moderate, and 33 (7.0%) severe. Most injuries (296 or 63.1%) affected the lower extremities, with the knee being the most common location (37.1%), followed by the ankle (28.3%), thigh (13.2%), heel (11.2%), toes (5.7%), and other areas (4.4%). It was performed a prospective study in Malaysia involving 69 adolescent badminton players over a one-year period . During this period, 63 injuries were recorded, resulting in an incidence of 1.09 injuries per player per year and 0.9 injuries per 1,000 training hours

This group faces a 57% injury risk . Lower extremity injuries are particularly common (54.3%), with foot injuries alone accounting for 22.9%. Muscle strains are the most frequent type of injury, representing 51.4% of cases. Smashes and lunges are often implicated in injuries to both upper and lower extremities. Notably, elite athletes report that a majority of injuries occur during the first third of the game (46.2%) . Recent studies corroborate that injuries are most likely to happen in the early phases of a match and detail the specific injury sites in elite athletes. However, the mechanisms and specific injury sites in badminton's general player population remain poorly understood. Consequently, further experimental and observational studies are essential to explore injury patterns and improve diagnosis in this demographic. Such research is crucial to assist the public in safely engaging with badminton and in preventing chronic injuries.

Content: The findings of this systematic review pave the way for various future research directions that are important to develop and strengthen the evidence base in badminton injury rehabilitation. Firstly, longitudinal studies that evaluate the long-term effectiveness of evidence-based rehabilitation protocols are needed. This will provide insight into the durability of the intervention and its potential effect in preventing re-injury. Secondly, there is a need for more specific research on the most common injuries in badminton, such as knee and ankle injuries, with a focus on customised rehabilitation approaches for these injuries. In addition, future research could also explore the integration of new technologies, such as virtual reality and wearable technologies, in rehabilitation programmes. These technologies have the potential to increase player engagement in the rehabilitation process and allow for better monitoring of recovery. Finally, comparative studies between traditional and innovative rehabilitation approaches could provide additional evidence on the most effective methods for specific conditions. By exploring these areas, future research could make a significant contribution towards the development of more effective and efficient injury rehabilitation practices in badminton.

Content: From the research of this paper, we can see that although badminton has many benefits, the sports injury brought by badminton cannot be underestimated. Therefore, in daily sports training, we should establish self-defense awareness and effectively avoid some situations that are prone to sports injury, so as to reduce the occurrence of sports injury as much as possible. In case of sports injury, it is necessary to deal with it in time and seek medical treatment quickly, so as to reduce the treatment time and delay the treatment as much as possible, so as to avoid the deterioration of sports injury. For patients with sports injury, it is not enough to only use the traditional massage and stretching method. It also needs to be combined with physical exercise. For the area where the injury problem occurs, combine physical training with rehabilitation training, and design corresponding actions for training, so as to make the effect of sports rehabilitation more remarkable.

Content: A systematic review focused on evaluating evidence-based rehabilitation approaches in badminton could provide valuable insights into best practices. Through a comprehensive review of the existing literature, researchers can identify the most effective rehabilitation strategies while uncovering areas that require further research. A study by (Steffen et al., 2013) successfully implemented this method to evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention training programmes in team sports, demonstrating the potential of systematic reviews in informing clinical practice. Recognising the importance of an evidence-based approach, this study aimed to review the available literature regarding injury rehabilitation in badminton systematically. The aim was to identify, evaluate, and synthesise evidence from studies that have been conducted on this topic to offer reliable recommendations for players, coaches, and healthcare professionals. As such, this study not only contributes to the body of knowledge regarding injury rehabilitation in badminton but also supports the implementation of evidence-based practices in the management of sports injuries more broadly.

Content: Participation in sporting activities, including lifestyle sports, enhances quality of life by promoting health and fulfilling social roles through the use of leisure time for physical fitness . These activities are typically organized within club settings, which are prevalent due to the numerous benefits derived from engaging in group sports rather than individual activities. Badminton, in particular, enjoys widespread popularity both in Korea and globally, with a significant number of active participants . Racquet sports like badminton are often considered to be relatively safe due to their limited physical contact compared to other sports, which ostensibly lowers the risk of injury. Nevertheless, badminton, the fastest of the racquet sports, involves predominantly overhead shots and demands high levels of aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and accuracy. It is a skill-intensive sport requiring fine motor coordination and precise racquet movements . Despite its perceived safety, the dynamic and vigorous nature of badminton leads to a significant incidence of injuries. This sport requires extensive physical manipulation, including twisting, turning, and jumping, to accommodate the rapid changes in the speed and direction of the shuttlecock . Research indicates that strains are the most prevalent injury among elite badminton players, with the most affected areas being the lower back, shoulders, thighs, and knees .

Content: Knee joint injury is one of the common injuries in badminton. There are many researches at home and abroad, and the importance of knee joint injury is getting higher and higher. Incorrect badminton movement techniques, excessive sports and incorrect sports hygiene habits can all cause different degrees of injuries. In sports training, attention should be paid to the arrangement of content and load according to physical characteristics, training level and training period. Ideological education for athletes should also be strengthened to establish a correct outlook on life and world outlook. Before training or exercise, the knee joint should be well prepared, and vigorous energy should be maintained during exercise. When physical strength decreases and body fatigue occurs, great exercise should be avoided as much as possible to prevent injury. Improving the ability of knee joint becomes an indispensable part of badminton. At the same time, to master the correct technology of badminton and do a good job of special preparation is a problem worthy of attention in this mass sports activity. On the basis of not affecting the action sensitivity, properly increase the anti twist performance of the forefoot of the badminton shoes, reduce the turnover of the forefoot, so as to reduce the load moving to the inside. Before training or exercise, the knee joint should be well prepared for exercise. During exercise, keep vigorous energy. When the physical strength drops and the body is tired, try to avoid large exercise to prevent injury.

Our results are comparable with the injury rate results of other racket sports, such as tennis, where injury incidences range between 0.04 and 3.0 injuries/1000 hours were found. 38 The dominance of lower body injuries compared with upper body injuries is similar to other racket sports. Most upper body injuries in tennis tend to be overuse injuries, while injuries of the lower body are more likely to be caused by trauma. 38 As there seems to be no clear consensus on the distinction between acute and overuse injuries in badminton, a direct comparison with other sports remains challenging. Different injury frequencies have been identified in tennis, although neither of the two types of injury (acute/ overuse) appears to dominate. 38 If we compare the injury rates in badminton with those of other non- contact individual sports such as gymnastics, we find comparable injury rates of 1-4 injuries/1000 hours with few outliers. 39 For professional golfers, an injury rate of three injuries per player was found retrospectively over an observation period of two golf seasons. 40 For the amateur golfer, two injuries per player have been observed. 40 A total of 637 injuries were identified in 703 players. However, this study did not indicate that injury incidence was adjusted per 1000 hours of play.

By sorting and analyzing the data over the years, questionnaires were sent to relevant personnel to analyze the degree and type of sports injury. The results are shown in Figure 1 and 2. It can be seen from the results in Figure 1 that although there are relatively many sports injuries in badminton and they are widely distributed, they are relatively mild injuries, such as slight sprain, strain or joint dislocation. These injuries often do not bring too much interference to the daily life of athletes, and only need to go to the hospital for simple treatment. Some athletes choose not to go to the hospital and can recover by applying drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Therefore, the degree of injury of badminton players is relatively light injury, but there are also some cases of moderate injury and severe Figure 1.

Content: This study provides valuable insights into injury rehabilitation approaches in badminton, emphasising evidence-based principles. Compared to previous studies, this systematic review highlights the importance of integrating findings from various disciplines, including sports medicine, physiotherapy and sports psychology, to build a holistic rehabilitation strategy. For example, a study by (Feng &amp; Wang, 2023) focused on the physical aspects of rehabilitation. In contrast, the researchers' findings suggested that psychological recovery also plays an important role in player well-being. Furthermore, a study by (Shi &amp; Han, 2022), which used a quantitative approach in assessing the effectiveness of specific exercises, contributed to the evidence in favour of several rehabilitation techniques. However, the researcher's review added to the literature by highlighting the need for a more individualised approach, acknowledging the variation in injury and recovery responses between players. The alignments and differences with this study suggest that while there is consensus on some basic principles of rehabilitation, its practical application requires a broader consideration of players' specific needs and conditions. This underlines the importance of ongoing research to optimise injury rehabilitation strategies in badminton with an approach that is evidence-based and considers multidisciplinary aspects.

Content: The mean injury rate in all studies was between 1 and 4 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure, and the incidences tended to be at the upper end in the studies conducted with elite players only. Lower body injuries occurred most frequently, including strains, sprains, tendinopathies and stress fractures, with a high proportion of overuse injuries. All studies considering the time to RTP reported a greater proportion of less than 28 days of lost time. The studies that used the AIS scale for categorisation also described the majority of all injuries as minor or moderate rather than severe. Due to the heterogeneous findings in the studies presented here, the risk factors described (high level of play, injury history, pronounced susceptibility of the lower extremities and many overuse injuries) can only be emphasised with caution. The studies included in this review differ substantially regarding injury definitions and data collection methods. More research should be carried out in the field of risk factors to obtain more information on the epidemiology of badminton and avoid injuries more frequently in the future. Better data (large, multicentre prospective cohort studies) methodologically based on published consensus statements are needed to stabilise the tentative findings. In addition, studies in which injury rates are recorded strictly according to different characteristics (eg, gender, level and training frequency) are particularly useful. This further development of the epidemiological report would also help injury monitoring and injury prevention in elite sports since 'Top shape and injuries are close neighbours'. 60 Acknowledgements We thank all reviewers and the responsible editor for their valuable and constructive comments on the first submitted version of this manuscript.

Content: Badminton, as a sport that demands speed, accuracy, and agility, often causes injuries to players. These injuries can reduce their quality of life and athletic careers. Therefore, effective and evidence-based injury rehabilitation is crucial for recovery and prevention of re-injury. This study aims to systematise the current evidence regarding injury rehabilitation methods in badminton and evaluate their effectiveness in supporting player well-being. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines; this study screened and analysed studies from Pub Med, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria included studies that evaluated injury rehabilitation programmes specifically for badminton players, with outcome measures of functional recovery, pain reduction, and prevention of re-injury. Quality assessment was conducted using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) tool, and data were extracted for thematic analysis. The results showed that a combination of physical therapy, strengthening exercises, and manual intervention techniques such as joint mobilisation and manipulation provided the most effective outcomes in injury rehabilitation. There is strong evidence supporting the use of proprioceptive training to prevent re-injury. Factors such as player age, initial injury severity, and adherence to the rehabilitation programme were shown to influence recovery success. This study concludes that the approach to injury rehabilitation in badminton should be multidisciplinary, integrating various physiotherapy techniques for optimal outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of a tailored and evidence-based rehabilitation programme in supporting athletes' recovery and preventing possible future injuries. This study also suggests the need for further research to develop specific and standardised rehabilitation guidelines for badminton players.

Content: Badminton, recognized as one of the most popular sports in the world, demands extreme speed, accuracy, and endurance from its players. Although it presents many health and fitness benefits, the intensity and physical requirements of the sport inherently increase the risk of injury for its athletes. According to a study by (Marchena-Rodriguez et al., 2020), the prevalence of injuries among competitive badminton players ranged from 2.9 to 9.5 injuries per 1000 hours played, with injuries to the ankle and knee being the most common. These findings highlight the importance of effective rehabilitation strategies for recovery and future injury prevention. Evidence-based approaches in injury rehabilitation have gained widespread recognition in the past decade as the best method in the management of sports injuries. This approach relies on empirical data from controlled studies to inform clinical practice, ensuring that patients receive the most effective interventions available. For example, (Thibaut et al., 2022) emphasized the importance of this approach in improving rehabilitation outcomes for shoulder injuries, proposing that clinical decisions should be based on current scientific evidence rather than on tradition or personal preference. However, despite advances in medical research and practice, there are still gaps in the application of evidence-based approaches specific to injury rehabilitation in badminton. This is due to variations in injury type, severity, and the individual athletes involved. According to (Malwanage et al., 2022), the unique dynamics and movements in badminton require an in-depth understanding of injury mechanisms and rehabilitation interventions specific to this sport. This suggests the need for more focused studies to understand how best to apply evidence-based rehabilitation principles in the badminton context.

Content: These injuries not only diminish the performance of elite athletes but also adversely affect the sustained engagement of the general public in badminton. This can culminate in a decline in sports participation. While the post-injury rehabilitation phase is important to ensure continued participation and performance in badminton, it is the prevention of injuries before rehabilitation that is crucial. To do this, it is important to recognize and manage the site, tissue, and cause of injuries in amateur badminton players. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore sports injuries among amateur badminton players involved in recreational activities. The findings aim to provide a foundation for developing effective injury prevention and training programs.

Content: The most frequently injured body tissues during both competition and training are muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Hy et al. examined 2620 badminton players with an average age of 31 years and reported that the most common injuries were sprains (56%), Achilles tendon ruptures (13%), and ankle ligament ruptures (23.2%) . Guermont et al. studied elite badminton players and found that musculotendinous injuries were the most prevalent, accounting for 51.4% of injuries . Among Swedish players, ligament sprains are the predominant knee injury, whereas patellar tendinopathy is more common among Malaysian players . Badminton is characterized by high-intensity activity punctuated by brief rest periods, demanding rapid movements and agile footwork. This regimen of repetitive motions significantly stresses both upper and lower limbs, elevating the risk of both acute and chronic injuries of various severities . The lower extremity musculature plays a crucial role, as it frequently executes fast, powerful movements using body weight during gameplay . Such repetitive actions lead to muscle and joint fatigue and increased laxity in the musculoskeletal system, which includes muscles, tendons, and ligaments, thereby heightening the risk of injury . The findings of this study, along with previous research, indicate that muscles, ligaments, and tendons are the tissues most commonly injured in amateur badminton players, underscoring the need for a systematic and scientifically based injury prevention program that focuses on strengthening these peripheral muscles and enhancing stability.

Content: Types of Injuries: Injuries in badminton are common due to the high intensity and repetitive movements demanded by the sport. The most common injuries include ankle sprain, knee, shoulder, and back injuries, which can vary from acute injuries like sprains to chronic injuries like tendinitis. The sport requires a combination of speed, strength, and flexibility, which places great stress on various muscle groups and joints, especially when movements are performed with incorrect technique or inadequate equipment (Bertrando, 2018). An ankle sprain is one of the most commonly reported injuries, often resulting from improper landing after a jump or sudden movement to change direction. An epidemiological study by (Wang, 2023) found that these injuries are highly prevalent among badminton players, highlighting the importance of prevention through adequate warm-up and the use of proper footwear. Knee injuries, including sprained ligaments and meniscus damage, are also common, as shown by a study conducted by (Weber et al., 2020) which highlights how repetitive motion and overloading of the knee can lead to serious injuries. In addition, shoulder injuries are often experienced by badminton players due to repetitive overhead movements, such as smashes and serves, which can lead to overuse injuries such as rotator cuff tendinitis. Studies by (Zhou et al., 2022) have identified that these repetitive movements without adequate rest can increase the risk of shoulder injuries. Back injuries are also a concern, especially among players who perform a lot of smashes and serves, where excessive rotation and extension of the spine can lead to injury. Research (Dutta &amp; SV, 2021) suggests that improper practice and technique can cause undue stress on the back, triggering or exacerbating injuries.

Content: 1. Ankle Sprains : One of the most prevalent badminton injuries, ankle sprains are caused by sudden direction changes or landing awkwardly after a jump. Players tend to twist their ankles, leading to swelling, pain, and decreased mobility. 2. Cause : Sudden lateral movements, uneven ground, or unstable stabilizing muscles. 3. Recovery time: Minor sprains take only a few days, while bad ones could require weeks of rest and physiotherapy. 2. Shoulder Injuries (Rotator Cuff Strain): Badminton requires strong overhead strokes such as smashes and clears, which place continuous stress on the shoulder joint. Rotator cuff injury can be caused by overuse or bad technique. 5. Cause : Prolonged overhead action, poor posture, or insufficiency of shoulder conditioning. 6. Recovery time : Ranges from a few days of rest to a few weeks of physical therapy. 3. Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis): Notwithstanding its nomenclature, tennis elbow occurs frequently in badminton players. The injury is characterized by inflammation of tendons that connect the forearm muscles to the lateral aspect of the elbow. 8. Cause : Repetitive gripping or faulty handling of the racket. 9. Recovery period : 6 weeks to several months, depending on extent of injury. 4. Knee Injuries (Patellar Tendonitis &amp; ACL Strains): The jumping, sharp stops, and lunges of badminton are tough on the knees. Jumper's knee (patellar tendonitis) and strains to the ACL are common injuries, particularly when the knees aren't supported and warmed up appropriately. 11. Cause : Overuse, abrupt impact, or improper landing technique. 12. Recovery time : Several weeks to months, with potential medical care. 5. Wrist Strain : Because the wrist has to be flicked in order to deliver accurate badminton shots, it is common for players to suffer from wrist pain or tendinitis. 14. Cause : Overuse, excessive grip, or insufficient warm-up. 15. Recovery time: 1 to 2 weeks of rest and supportive bracing.

Content: Objectives As a high- intensity intermittent sport with short and repeated rapid accelerations, decelerations and changes of direction, badminton involves high joint and muscle loads. This review aims to identify relevant injury risk characteristics and factors that facilitate developing and implementing badminton- specific injury prevention programmes. Design This systematic review of badminton injuries assessed the risk of bias, injury incidence, mechanism, location, type, severity, and risk factors. Data sources Pub Med, Wo S, SURF, EBSCO, Ovid and SPORTDiscus. Eligibility criteria Only English or German peerreviewed articles presenting epidemiological data. All age groups, genders and levels of play were represented. Results Examination of 19 studies with male (60%) and female players (41%) at different player levels (age: 10-50 years). The mean injury incidence was between 1 and 4 injuries/1000 hours, whereby the incidence in the studies that were only carried out with elite players tended to be at the upper end. Lower body injuries occurred most frequently (41%-92%), including strains (11%-64%), sprains (10%-61%), tendinopathy (6%-14%) and stress fractures (5%-11%). There was a high proportion of overuse injuries (25%-74%) and a predominance of mild and moderate injuries (73%-100%). The following risk factors can only be cautiously emphasised due to the heterogeneous results: The risk of injury increases with increasing level of play and a history of injury. Conclusion Young players with a history of injury quickly moving to higher competition classes must be targeted with the highest injury prevention priority. Future studies should focus on improving the quality of studies by using comparable data collection methods.

Content: - With the help of knowledge about informative predictors (gender, age, training level, stress and strain parameters, etc.), injuries that occur during training and competition can be predicted using individualised models, allowing preventive measures to be introduced appropriately and at an early stage. This makes it possible to detect individual risk constellations for coaches and athletes. high intensity with many accelerations, decelerations and direction changes alternate with longer periods of lower intensity during the rally breaks. 2 5 6 Complex interactions between technical, tactical, physiological and psychological skills are key. 7 Although badminton is considered a non- contact sport, injuries are remarkably common in badminton. 8 The injury frequency is between 1 and 4 injuries/1000 hours, although some studies also indicate injury rates of up to 7 injuries/1000 hours. The <!-- image --> range of injury incidence estimates reported in previous reviews is wide, even within the elite- player segment. 8 The epidemiological uncertainty in badminton is further challenged by methodological heterogeneity and differences in performance levels, study quality, sex and age groups. 8 Both acute and overuse injuries are caused by typical repetitive movement patterns, such as lunges, jumps, quick direction changes and overhead strokes, as these movements exert high stress on both the lower and upper extremities. 8 Injuries rarely occur due to collisions with the doubles partner's racket or the double partner themselves. 8 Eye injuries occur more commonly in racket sports and have been the subject of many studies. 9 While there is a considerable body of work on injury epidemiology in badminton, the heterogeneity and amount of previous work precluded a meta- analytical work. Consequently, we opted for a narrative summary.

Content: This study provides valuable insights into injury rehabilitation approaches in badminton, emphasising evidence-based principles. Compared to previous studies, this systematic review highlights the importance of integrating findings from various disciplines, including sports medicine, physiotherapy and sports psychology, to build a holistic rehabilitation strategy. For example, a study by (Feng &amp; Wang, 2023) focused on the physical aspects of rehabilitation. In contrast, the researchers' findings suggested that psychological recovery also plays an important role in player well-being. Furthermore, a study by (Shi &amp; Han, 2022), which used a quantitative approach in assessing the effectiveness of specific exercises, contributed to the evidence in favour of several rehabilitation techniques. However, the researcher's review added to the literature by highlighting the need for a more individualised approach, acknowledging the variation in injury and recovery responses between players. The alignments and differences with this study suggest that while there is consensus on some basic principles of rehabilitation, its practical application requires a broader consideration of players' specific needs and conditions. This underlines the importance of ongoing research to optimise injury rehabilitation strategies in badminton with an approach that is evidence-based and considers multidisciplinary aspects.

Content: The strength of this study lies in its large sample size, which includes senior badminton players. However, this study has several limitations. First, as this was a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, participants may have had inaccurate recollections and misunderstandings, leading to inconsistent data. Additionally, lengthy questionnaires can cause participant fatigue and reduce response quality. Second, this study focused on the musculoskeletal injuries related to badminton. Patients with injuries to other organs, such as the eyes, were not included. Further research is necessary to identify the incidence and severity of these injuries and develop effective injury prevention plans. Third, although our study identified the knee and ankle as the most commonly affected body parts, particularly during direction changes in play, we recognize the need for more comprehensive preventive strategies against these injuries. We are optimistic that future studies focusing on comprehensive methods will help fill this knowledge gap and improve the prevention and minimization of badminton-related injuries.

Limited research is available on badminton-related injuries among senior Asian players. This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire to gather data on demographics, exercise habits, injury history, injury mechanisms, affected body parts, symptoms, and injury severity from 254 participants. Most participants were male (70.6%), with a median age of 46 years (inter-quartile range [IQR] = 16.0). The median injury incidence was 4.3 per 1,000 hours played (IQR = 6.5). The most commonly injured body parts on the dominant side were the knees (51.1%), ankles (36.3%), and shoulders/clavicles (25.5%). On the non-dominant side, the knee (34.2%) and ankle (25.5%) were frequently injured. The most common mechanism of knee and ankle injuries occurs during changes in direction. Common injuries included ankle sprains (23.5%), patellar tendinopathy (20.3%), and muscle cramps (31.6%). Most injuries (60.6%) were mild.

Content: Badminton is considered as one of the fastest racket sports (Phomsoupha and Laffaye, 2015; Abdullahi and Coetzee, 2017; Gomez et al., 2021), requiring frequent quick starts, stops, lunges, and changes of direction (Shariff et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2014). These high-intensity and quick movements and reactions in badminton significantly increased the risks of injuries to lower extremities, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of knees, one type of injury that frequently occurs in badminton athletes (Kimura et al., 2012; Alikhani et al., 2019; Zhao and Gu, 2019). In addition, badminton matches require players to adjust their body position continuously throughout the game, in which their capacity of dynamic balance to maintain their center of gravity within the base of support to react to the moving shuttlecock (Faude et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2013).

Content: Badminton is a sport that can cause injuries, although most are not caused by body-to-body contact [6, 21]. This may result in increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in older populations . Understanding the incidence and mechanisms of injuries can be beneficial for planning injury prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on badminton-related injuries, particularly among Asian senior players. Our findings demonstrated that approximately 77% of the participants had experienced badminton-related injuries in the past year. The incidence of injuries was approximately 4 injuries per 1,000 hours played. The most commonly affected body parts were the knee and ankle, regardless of the dominant or nondominant side. The mechanism of these injuries is associated with changing direction while playing. Forehand smashes are the most common badminton shots that cause injuries. However, most injuries were classified as minor and required less than one week for recovery. Common pain management methods include massage, oral analgesics, and physical rehabilitation.

Content: - Studies that have reported on eye injuries have determined 460 - the nature of these injuries and the way they occur. They 461 - have also suggested possible preventive measures. The main 462 - reason for eye injury is shuttlecock impact from an oppo463 - nent's stroke; thus, by wearing glasses, badminton players 464 can considerably reduce the risk of eye injury. Injuries to the arm and shoulder in badminton are largely due to faulty technique, while leg and back injuries are caused mainly by a lack of strength or mobility. The contribution of the trunk to the prevention of lower limb injuries suggests that specific attention should be paid to this area. In general, the patellar tendon is put under serious stress in badminton . Studies have shown that a substantial number of elite badminton players have patellar tendon pain and 'jumper's knee' . Male badminton players have a significantly higher incidence of painful patellar tendons . Rapid changes in the direction of movement, jumps and lunges can all result in injuries to the Achilles tendon and anterior cruciate ligament. Tendons are put under high pressure during each movement and, in general, injuries occur at the end of a training session or tournament. Fatigue influences the way that lunges are performed and the way that the jump is received by making these tendons less powerful and more unstable. Such knowledge could help coaches and fitness trainers focus on the specific muscular activities required to prevent injuries. For example, they could design a training program that increases body strength to prevent injuries to badminton players. The relationship between coaches and scientists, particularly in terms of biomechanics and physiotherapy, will help improve performance and prevent injury.

Content: The epidemiology of badminton injuries is not well documented and there is a lack of data in Thailand, particularly among senior players, given the country ' s aging population [20, 22]. It was analyzed 44 badminton athletes in Hong Kong . The overall incidence of injuries was 5.04 per 1,000 player hours. The highest incidence was among elite senior athletes (7.38), followed by elite junior athletes (5.03), and potential athletes (2.07). Elite senior athletes had a higher incidence of recurrent injuries, whereas elite junior athletes and potential athletes had higher incidences of new injuries. Most new injuries were strains (n = 80), with the most frequently injured body sites being the back (21.3%), shoulder (18.8%), thigh (18.8%), and knees (18.8%). It was conducted a retrospective case review in Malaysia . Over a period of 2.5 years, a total of 469 musculoskeletal injuries were diagnosed. Of these, 276 (58.8%) injuries occurred in badminton players aged &lt; 20 years old. The majority of injuries, 406 (86.6%) occurred during training or practice sessions, while only eight (1.7%) occurred during competitions. Overuse injuries were the most common type of injuries diagnosed at NSI clinics. In terms of injury severity, 429 (91.5%) were mild, 7 (1.5%) moderate, and 33 (7.0%) severe. Most injuries (296 or 63.1%) affected the lower extremities, with the knee being the most common location (37.1%), followed by the ankle (28.3%), thigh (13.2%), heel (11.2%), toes (5.7%), and other areas (4.4%). It was performed a prospective study in Malaysia involving 69 adolescent badminton players over a one-year period . During this period, 63 injuries were recorded, resulting in an incidence of 1.09 injuries per player per year and 0.9 injuries per 1,000 training hours

In case of the latter two, timely medical treatment and effective rehabilitation training must be carried out to prevent adverse effects on Athletes' sports skills or sports career due to contempt. It can be seen from the results in Figure 2 that badminton is a sport with large range of limb movement. Therefore, it is inevitable to strain and sprain in the overall movement process, which are also the injury types with the highest proportion. In addition, certain abrasions and contusions will inevitably occur in the process of running and catching the ball. Therefore, these two injuries rank in the middle reaches. In addition, for some athletes with long training years, long-term training will produce certain continuous pressure on their joints, resulting in joint strain and other problems. Therefore, this is also a major type of athletes' sports injury.

Content: Badminton is a repeating and burst-type sport. Overuse and strain injuries are frequent, but can be avoided using some simple tactics: - Rest Between Sessions: Don't overtrain. Take rest days to allow muscles time to recover. Overuse is a primary cause of tendonitis and joint problems. - Listen to Your Body: If you're hurting, stiff, or tired, don't push through it. If you rest early, you can keep a minor problem from becoming an ongoing injury. - Alternate Intensity: Alternate between days of high intensity and low intensity to allow specific muscle groups to recuperate. This approach prevents chronic strain injuries. - Regular Massage and Physiotherapy: Regular sports massages or physiotherapy interventions can facilitate early identification of tightness, muscle imbalance, and small injuries before they become major issues.

Content: From the research of this paper, we can see that although badminton has many benefits, the sports injury brought by badminton cannot be underestimated. Therefore, in daily sports training, we should establish self-defense awareness and effectively avoid some situations that are prone to sports injury, so as to reduce the occurrence of sports injury as much as possible. In case of sports injury, it is necessary to deal with it in time and seek medical treatment quickly, so as to reduce the treatment time and delay the treatment as much as possible, so as to avoid the deterioration of sports injury. For patients with sports injury, it is not enough to only use the traditional massage and stretching method. It also needs to be combined with physical exercise. For the area where the injury problem occurs, combine physical training with rehabilitation training, and design corresponding actions for training, so as to make the effect of sports rehabilitation more remarkable.

Although injuries in this sport are relatively rare when compared to other disciplines, the type of injury is usually serious and often requires long treatment and rehabilitation. Assessing motor behaviours often classified as movement patterns makes it possible to highlight abnormalities in the kinematic chain. According to Shultz et al. and Alentorn-Geli et al. , fatigue reduces the efficiency of movement patterns and impairs the process of neuromuscular control. Furthermore, Sarshin claims that as fatigue progresses, the ability of badminton players to maintain proper dynamic posture control drops, which increases the risk of knee injury . Joint sprains and ligament injuries in the lower extremities mainly affect younger badminton players, while muscle injuries are the most common in older players .

Muscle strains are the most frequent type of injury, representing 51.4% of cases. Smashes and lunges are often implicated in injuries to both upper and lower extremities. Notably, elite athletes report that a majority of injuries occur during the first third of the game (46.2%) . Recent studies corroborate that injuries are most likely to happen in the early phases of a match and detail the specific injury sites in elite athletes. However, the mechanisms and specific injury sites in badminton's general player population remain poorly understood. Consequently, further experimental and observational studies are essential to explore injury patterns and improve diagnosis in this demographic. Such research is crucial to assist the public in safely engaging with badminton and in preventing chronic injuries.

Content: In the sport process of badminton, players need to constantly change their positions according to the actual situation of the game to complete various combat actions, which brings a certain pressure to the athletes' knee joints, and it is easy to cause knee joint injuries. Therefore, this paper puts forward relevant recovery strategies for badminton players' knee injuries. The research results show that active restorative training has a good effect on the relief of knee joint pain and the improvement of stability of athletes, which is better than passive acupuncture and physiotherapy. Therefore, some targeted restorative training should be purposefully added to the knee joint rehabilitation of athletes, so that athletes can better recover their knee joints and return to the competition field.

In order to be more targeted, the survey objects of the questionnaire are badminton professional athletes who have a history of badminton injury. By sorting and analyzing the data over the years, questionnaires were sent to relevant personnel to analyze the degree and type of sports injury. The results are shown in Figure 1 and 2. It can be seen from the results in Figure 1 that although there are relatively many sports injuries in badminton and they are widely distributed, they are relatively mild injuries, such as slight sprain, strain or joint dislocation. These injuries often do not bring too much interference to the daily life of athletes, and only need to go to the hospital for simple treatment. Some athletes choose not to go to the hospital and can recover by applying drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis.

Content: The mean injury rate in all studies was between 1 and 4 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure, and the incidences tended to be at the upper end in the studies conducted with elite players only. Lower body injuries occurred most frequently, including strains, sprains, tendinopathies and stress fractures, with a high proportion of overuse injuries. All studies considering the time to RTP reported a greater proportion of less than 28 days of lost time. The studies that used the AIS scale for categorisation also described the majority of all injuries as minor or moderate rather than severe. Due to the heterogeneous findings in the studies presented here, the risk factors described (high level of play, injury history, pronounced susceptibility of the lower extremities and many overuse injuries) can only be emphasised with caution. The studies included in this review differ substantially regarding injury definitions and data collection methods. More research should be carried out in the field of risk factors to obtain more information on the epidemiology of badminton and avoid injuries more frequently in the future. Better data (large, multicentre prospective cohort studies) methodologically based on published consensus statements are needed to stabilise the tentative findings. In addition, studies in which injury rates are recorded strictly according to different characteristics (eg, gender, level and training frequency) are particularly useful. This further development of the epidemiological report would also help injury monitoring and injury prevention in elite sports since 'Top shape and injuries are close neighbours'. 60 Acknowledgements We thank all reviewers and the responsible editor for their valuable and constructive comments on the first submitted version of this manuscript.

Content: Common Approaches in Rehabilitation: A Review of Principles Injury rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of an athlete's recovery after injury, especially in intense sports such as badminton. The approach involves a series of steps designed to ensure effective and efficient recovery, reduce the risk of re-injury, and allow players to return to their peak performance. The basic principles of injury rehabilitation include rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE), followed by physical therapy and strengthening exercises aimed at restoring function, strength and mobility of the injured area ( Sara Horvat , 2024). Rest is the initial and perhaps most important step in the rehabilitation process. It not only refers to the cessation of the activity that caused the injury but also includes activity modification to avoid stressing the injured area. The application of ice immediately after the injury occurs can help reduce inflammation and pain, while compression and elevation contribute to the reduction of swelling (Kwiecien, 2023). After the initial phase of recovery, physical therapy plays an important role in injury rehabilitation. It involves a series of exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility and stability without overloading the injured area. The physical therapy approach should be individualised, considering the type of injury and the specific needs of the player (Carreno et al., 2021). Strengthening exercises are another important component of injury rehabilitation. It not only focuses on the injured area but also on strengthening the surrounding muscles and support structures to prevent re-injury. Research has shown that a structured exercise programme can significantly reduce the risk of re-injury and improve athletic performance (Dijksma et al., 2020).

Content: It has been proven that badminton not only enhances physical health but also mental and social well-being across numerous age groups . However, similar to other sports, it is also associated with musculoskeletal injuries. Badminton injuries make up approximately 1-5% of all sports injuries. According to previous studies, the risk of injuries in badminton is approximately 0.9 injuries per annum and 1-7 injuries per 1,000 hours of play . The lower limb is the most commonly affected in such injuries, with an estimated 58-92% of cases involving it. The knee is the most commonly injured part of the lower limb, followed by the ankle, with common injuries including strains, sprains, tendinopathy, and stress fractures . However, with most injuries categorized as mild to moderate in terms of severity, at least 20% of schoolchildren missed at least one day of school in a given year due to sports injuries. Furthermore, it was estimated that one in three working adults lost at least one day per year because of injuries from sports-related activities . Therefore, comprehensive preventive strategies must be implemented to mitigate adverse outcomes. It was proposed a four-step model for injury prevention . This model begins with the critical step of establishing the magnitude of the injury, followed by identifying the etiology and mechanisms of the injury. Subsequently, it involves the introduction of preventive measures and evaluation of their effectiveness. Population aging is a phenomenon that affects many countries worldwide, including those in Asia . The population aged over 60 years increased from 5% in 1995 to 17.1% in 2017 and is projected to increase to 30% by 2035 . This demographic shift has led to an increase in the number of elderly patients with sportsrelated trauma, potentially increasing its morbidity and mortality

Content: Among the sports injury types of badminton players, waist injury will not only have a certain impact on the athletes' sports career, but also lead to many inconveniences in the athletes' daily life. Therefore, the rehabilitation training for lumbar spine has always been a major focus of badminton injury rehabilitation research. This paper discusses the rehabilitation effect of Badminton Athletes' sports injury by means of inter group control. (Table 2) shows the range of motion of badminton players before and after rehabilitation training. It can be seen from Table 2 that the lumbar flexion of the experimental group changed from (86.626 3.163) before training to (90.009 1.178) after training, the lumbar extension changed from (26.573 1.171) before training to (29.859 1.388) after training, and the left lumbar flexion changed from (26.228 1.856) before training to (29.273 1.075) after training, The right lumbar flexion changed from (25.936 1.827) before training to (30.036 1.400) after training (P &lt; 0.01), indicating that there was a very significant difference.

Content: Badminton has now become a popular sport in our country and is deeply loved by the masses. With the continuous popularization and improvement of badminton, knee joint injury has also become a psychological obstacle to badminton lovers to play their technical level . Badminton is one of the traditional sports in our country, which integrates athletics, fun, fitness and entertainment. It can enhance the functions of human circulation, respiration and other systems, and improve the body's speed, strength, endurance, flexibility, sensitivity, coordination and other qualities. From the perspective of athletic footwork, badminton players' lower limb movements on the court include sudden stop, quick rise, return movement, take-off and so on . Most of them involve the basic movements of the lower limbs. Therefore, what kind of reasonable joint angle, speed and appropriate relative position of links to push the ground will be directly related to badminton performance. Badminton belongs to the skill-oriented type of net-separated competitive event group, which has the characteristics of intense antagonism, high intensity of sports and no time limit for competitions . The ability of human body joints to bear load is limited. When an action exceeds the limit that the body can bear, the body will suffer various acute or chronic injuries . If not handled properly, it will limit the fitness ability of the bodybuilder and have a huge impact on the work and life of the bodybuilder.

Content: The study identified the ankles, knees, and shoulders as the most commonly injured sites for both male and female athletes. Additionally, injuries to the waist during competition were noted among female athletes, and back injuries were observed during training for both genders. A retrospective study of elite badminton players in Hong Kong found that sprains were prevalent, particularly in the lower back, shoulders, thighs, and knees . The researchers attributed the frequent lumbar facet problems to repetitive lumbar extension during overhead and jump smashes in badminton, suggesting that these movements reflect the specific loading patterns on the lumbar spine . The occurrence of pain in the back, hips, knees, or feet is notably higher among athletes performing overhead movements. Pain in the elbows and/or shoulders often co-occurs with back and hip pain, more so than with knee and foot pain . Following seven conditioning sessions over three weeks, a world-class badminton player reported reduced knee pain and exhibited improved performance and cardiorespiratory fitness during agility tasks . The study also indicated that amateur badminton players, due to their relatively low training volume and less professional training regimen, may face a higher risk of injury compared to elite players. Therefore, it is essential for amateur players to receive proper training to minimize injury risks and to facilitate rehabilitation of injured sites.

This type of injury can reduce the athlete's career, and poor treatment can cause secondary injuries during the rehabilitation period, requiring a thorough study of the causes and treatment methods. Objective: Study the causes and rehabilitation methods of knee joint injuries in badminton players. Methods: Junior badminton students and professional players from a university volunteered for a study on the causes of their knee joint injuries and the various types of rehabilitation training they were allocated to. The control group was treated with traditional physical therapy, and the experimental group was treated with slow recovery training under the guidance of doctors and teachers. The experiment lasted 6 weeks, and pain recovery and joint stability index were the main indicators. Results: Knee joint injuries in athletes often occur when performing intense or unfamiliar movements. The scores of the experimental group evolved rapidly during the 6 weeks of rehabilitation. The total stability index before training was 6.3432 0.4647 versus 5.7190 0.3747 after the experiment. Conclusion: Training in the physical rehabilitation of knee joint injuries in athletes has a good effect on pain relief and gain in joint stability, proving to be superior to acupuncture and traditional physiotherapy. Therefore, adding this restorative training protocol to knee joint rehabilitation in athletes is recommended. Level of evidence II; Therapeutic studies - investigation of treatment outcomes.

Content: <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 1. Proper Warm-Up and Cool-Down : One of the most neglected but important badminton injury prevention advice is warming up correctly ahead of a match or practice session. This enhances blood supply, improves flexibility, and readies the muscles for high-intensity action. 2. Warm-up : 10-15 minutes of easy cardio, dynamic stretching, arm circles, and lunges. 3. Cool-down : Gentle running followed by static stretching to unwind the muscles. 2. Strength and Conditioning : Conditioning your body, particularly the core, knees, shoulders, and ankles, is essential in preventing injury in badminton. 5. Strengthening exercises such as squats, lunges, planks, and shoulder presses should be prioritized. 6. Include resistance band exercises for joints and smaller stabilizer muscles. 3. Mastering Proper Technique : A large proportion of injuries are caused by technique or form. Your grip, footwork, or shot technique-whichever it is-can be corrected by an experienced coach to minimize the chance of strain. 8. Do not overextend when smashing. 9. Maintain proper lunge technique to prevent knee stress. 10. Apply wrist and shoulder strength correctly on shots. 4. Use Appropriate Footwear : Shoes for badminton are made with lateral support, traction, and cushioning to shock-absorb and stabilize. Worn or ill-fitting shoes substantially elevate the risk of injury. 12. Replace shoes when soles become worn or after 70-100 hours of use. 13. Skip running shoes as they do not have the lateral support badminton requires. 5. Hydration and Nutrition : A healthy and well-fed body recovers quicker and works better. Dehydration may cause muscle cramping and poor concentration, leading to accidents. 15. Drink water prior to, during, and after play. 16. Add foods that are high in protein, calcium, and magnesium for muscle and bone strength.

Content: In the development of modern sports, the competitiveness of sports becomes stronger and the competition becomes more fierce, which greatly increases the probability of sports injuries. 1 In the actual combat of badminton, due to frequent lower limb exertion, it is likely to cause knee joint sports injuries. And among the types of injuries of badminton players, knee joint sports injuries are also more common. 2 The knee joint movement has brought not small influence to many badminton players. In addition, it is also very common to suffer from secondary knee injuries during the rehabilitation period. 3 Therefore, a thorough study of the causes of badminton players' knee injuries can provide sufficient theoretical support for athletes, effectively reduce the probability of sports accidents, and provide a certain degree of security for athletes' career. 4 In this paper, the junior and above badminton students in a university are taken as the research object to study the causes of knee joint injuries of these badminton players, and carry out some rehabilitation training to explore their recovery effects.

Content: Previous research, including our study, has established that injuries in badminton players typically occur in both the upper and lower extremities. In the upper extremities, the most frequently affected areas are the shoulders and the lower back, whereas the knees and ankles are the predominant injury sites in the lower extremities, with ligament sprains and muscle injuries being the most common types of tissue damage. Given the nature of badminton, which demands high-intensity actions such as jumping, landing, rapid directional changes, and high-impact movements, there is a compelling need for injury prevention training to mitigate the risk of injuries. Consequently, developing an injury prevention program for amateur badminton players is essential to prevent injuries and enhance performance, preventing the progression to chronic injuries.

It ranked six after soccer, basketball, volleyball, long-distance running and cycling. Prospects and projects. -Such knowledge could help coaches and fitness trainers focus on the specific muscular activities required to prevent injuries. The relationship between scientists and coaches, particularly in terms of biomechanics and physiotherapy, will help improve performance and prevent injury. Conclusion. -Badminton will be influenced by the evolution of intensity of the game. It is apparent that the movement patterns and movement demands are related to an increase in injuries and the generation of new injuries. Eye injury occurs when shuttlecock impact from an opponent's stroke. Wearing glasses can considerably reduce the risk of eye injury. Injuries to the arm and shoulder are due to faulty technique, while leg and back injuries are caused mainly by a lack of strength or mobility. The contribution of the trunk to the prevention of lower limb injuries suggests that specific attention should be paid to this area.

Studies have shown that female players play a higher percentage of shots from the back of the court and that the upper extremity injuries that occur are unique to racket sports . A retrospective study found that the incidence rate of injuries is 5.04 per 1000 hours of play, and that the shoulder is the most frequently affected location, 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 followed by the hand (Table 4). follow-through phases generates a stress to the epiphyseal plate. In fact, a study has shown that the rotator cuff in badminton players on the dominant arm is stronger than that of the non-dominant arm . The ratio between eccentric antagonist and concentric agonist strength is important when analyzing shoulder symptoms experienced by badminton players . During the cocking phase, the ratios of strength were found to be 2.15:1 for the dominant side and 1.71:1 for the non-dominant side; whereas the ratios were 0.97:1 for the dominant side and 1.08:1 for the nondominant side during the deceleration phase .

Content: Badminton not only has strong interest, but also can comprehensively train the whole body strength, including the core of upper limbs and lower limbs, so as to improve the flexibility of the body. It can also effectively alleviate the problems of shoulder and neck stiffness caused by long-time desk work. Therefore, it is widely loved by many people in contemporary times. 1 Badminton is also an advantageous project in China's Olympic Games. Therefore, badminton has a wide audience and a great development market in China, and has good research value. Although badminton can activate all parts of the body to a great extent, it will also have a certain impact on the body due to too intense exercise or insufficient preparation. 2 According to the literature, badminton sports injuries are widely distributed, such as ligament strain, patella injury, muscle strain and so on. 3 According to the literature, badminton players often have different degrees of strain in the fourth year of training. Therefore, when training, we should have a sense of protection and carry out rehabilitation training for the parts prone to sports injury. 4 After analyzing the current sports injury of athletes, the literature puts forward that for the sports injury of badminton athletes, we should pay attention to strengthening the training of wrist flexibility and hand strength, pay attention to footwork during sports, and bear more strength by thigh muscles, so as to reduce the pressure of knee joint. 5 It is also proposed in the literature that for the problem of sports injury, massage can be used to relieve the muscles and joints of the whole body, so as to alleviate the strain caused by sports. 6

Content: Badminton involves singles and doubles matches characterized by jumps, lunges, rapid directional changes, and swift arm movements, which frequently lead to injuries across various body parts . Once injured, players often find it challenging to return to the sport and are at a high risk of recurrent injuries if they do not take adequate precautions . Research indicates that during competitions, injuries are most prevalent at the waist, followed by the ankle, knees, and shoulders, whereas during training, the back, knees, and shoulders are most affected. Studies of elite badminton players have highlighted that injuries to the lower limbs are most common during international competitions, followed by injuries to the feet and upper limbs . At the European Senior Championships, injuries were predominantly reported in the knees, legs, and shoulders of participants . The average age of the 469 badminton players studied was 19.2 years, ranging from 13 to 52 years; about 60% of the injuries occurred in players under 20 years of age, with the knees being particularly vulnerable . Consistent with prior findings, this study found that the knees and ankles of the lower limbs and the shoulders and waist of the upper limbs were most susceptible to injury. Ankle and knee injuries, particularly common in players who frequently jump, often involve ankle sprains during plantar-flexed and inverted movements, primarily during landing or turning . Moreover, non-contact injuries were also noted, occurring through improper movements and sliding. While singles players experience injuries primarily from non-contact mechanisms, doubles players sustain more injuries through interactions with other players than from any external contacts.

Content: The injury incidence was mainly between 1 and 4 injuries/1000 hours. Some studies with higher and lower rates exist. Our results are comparable with the injury rate results of other racket sports, such as tennis, where injury incidences range between 0.04 and 3.0 injuries/1000 hours were found. 38 The dominance of lower body injuries compared with upper body injuries is similar to other racket sports. Most upper body injuries in tennis tend to be overuse injuries, while injuries of the lower body are more likely to be caused by trauma. 38 As there seems to be no clear consensus on the distinction between acute and overuse injuries in badminton, a direct comparison with other sports remains challenging. Different injury frequencies have been identified in tennis, although neither of the two types of injury (acute/ overuse) appears to dominate. 38 If we compare the injury rates in badminton with those of other non- contact individual sports such as gymnastics, we find comparable injury rates of 1-4 injuries/1000 hours with few outliers. 39 For professional golfers, an injury rate of three injuries per player was found retrospectively over an observation period of two golf seasons. 40 For the amateur golfer, two injuries per player have been observed. 40 A total of 637 injuries were identified in 703 players. However, this study did not indicate that injury incidence was adjusted per 1000 hours of play.

We assessed 504 amateur badminton players (302 males, 202 females) competing in the 2023 National Badminton Tournament in South Korea. This study focused on players involved in doubles matches, omitting singles competitors. Participants were divided into categories based on competitive and training sessions to document the location and type of injuries sustained. During competitions, the most frequently injured body parts were the waist (11.92%), ankle (11.66%), and knees and shoulders (11.53% each). In training sessions, injuries primarily affected the back and knees (12.43%) and shoulders (12.21%). The most common types of injuries during competitions were to muscles (35.60%), ligaments (29.32%), and tendons (12.04%), and during training to muscles (39.91%), ligaments (26.68%), and tendons (13.23%). Injuries resulting from player-to-player contact represented 19.44% of cases, while those involving non-player elements such as facility equipment accounted for 16.47%. There is a critical need to develop targeted injury prevention programs for amateur badminton players to mitigate injuries and enhance performance, thereby helping prevent the progression to chronic injury stages.

Content: Different types of studies have been conducted to assess the possible reasons for pain and injuries due to cycling. For instance, the association with other sports activities, 3 bicycle misalignment, 4 inexperience or lack of pre-ride conditioning, 8 and long distances ride 10 were among the suggested triggers for knee pain. Dettori and Norvel, 11 discussed some possible mechanisms for non-traumatic injuries and prevention plan. As an example, for patellofemoral inflammation, the saddle could be too low and/or too far forward and most authors have encouraged to follow preventive adjustments, like proper saddle adjustment, the use of orthotics, cleat adjustment, and reduction in gear ratio (especially early in the season), among others. 1,2,12,13 However, only a few of these strategies have been tested experimentally, and most of the advocated recommendations lack of solid evidence that could be important in preventing injuries. Sabeti-Aschraf et al 14 investigated 169 competitive mountain bikers and correlated their injury occurrence with the configuration of their bicycles. They found that 87 had overuse injuries after a race (Babenberger Trophy) and observed a significant correlation between inadequate saddle-pedal distance and knee pain ( p &lt; 0.04). They concluded that bicycle adjustments have a direct impact on the incidence of overuse injuries in the competitive mountain bike cyclist. Conversely, Dahlquist et al 7 declared in their study that flexibility, strength, and bike fit measures did not predict injury and concluded that injury risk and prevention strategies need additional studies. There are a minimum of 20 review articles published suggesting how to prevent and treat knee pain and injuries despite lack evidence supporting the current advocated practices. With this in mind, the determinants of overuse injuries and pain in cyclists that are supported by evidence remain unclear.

Our study aimed at assessing, using a systematic search of the most updated evidence, the main factors related to overuse knee-related pain and/or injuries in cyclists. The search assessed any potential mechanism related to knee pain or injury that could be used in the clinical practice. Databases were searched (i.e., Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO). Studies were included if they presented results from original studies. They had to include, preferably but not limited to, recreational and/or competitive cyclists with or without knee pain. Quality of articles was assessed. Eleven articles were deemed eligible for full text appraisal. Studies involved generally the assessment of biomechanical outcomes associated with knee pain in cyclists. Overall, studies showed that cyclists with knee pain present larger knee adduction and larger ankle dorsiflexion and differences in activation for hamstrings and quadriceps muscles. Unclear results were observed for knee moments and no differences were observed for knee flexion angle, tibiofemoral and patellofemoral forces. It is important to state that varied types of knee pain were mixed in most studies, with 2 focused on anterior-related pain. Cyclists with overuse-related pain or injuries on their knees presented an increased medial projection of their knees and an altered activation of the Vastus Medialis and Vastus Lateralis muscles. However, this limited evidence is based on retrospective studies comparing cyclists with and without pain, which limits the conclusion on how cyclists develop knee pain and what are the main options for treatment of knee pain.

Content: Expanding the horizon of overuse (non-traumatic) injuries in cycling, Dettori and Norvel 11 indicated that only a few of the components of the bicycle could be associated to the likelihood of developing an overuse injury, none of them related to knee pain. Changes in saddle design and changing the inclination of the saddle (tilt) were tested as positive to reduce numbness at the perineum and low back pain, respectively. One of the potential reasons for the lack of association between bicycle configuration and knee pain is due to the distribution of forces among the various muscles of the lower limb. 33 Many studies observed that changes in saddle height, for example, have different responses in terms of changes in ankle, knee, and hip angles. 33 This has been hypothesized because the large number of muscles crossing the 3 main joints in the lower limb allow for innumerous combinations of activations and muscle forces. Therefore, cyclists riding with a low saddle height, for example, could change their ankle and/or hip angles (via changes in muscle activation and forces), which could then minimize the load transferred through the knee joint. This mechanism could then postpone the observed increases in knee loads only when opting for extremely low saddle heights. 34 The rehabilitation of cyclists with knee pain or overuse injury requires a full understanding of the mechanism that Powered by TCPDF (w w.tcpdf.org)

This mechanism could then postpone the observed increases in knee loads only when opting for extremely low saddle heights. 34 The rehabilitation of cyclists with knee pain or overuse injury requires a full understanding of the mechanism that

Content: Background: The knee is susceptible to injury during cycling due to the repetitive nature of the activity while generating torque on the pedal. Knee pain is the most common overuse related injury reported by cyclists, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors can contribute to the development of knee pain. Purpose: Due to the potential for various knee injuries, this purpose of this systematic review of the literature was to determine the association between biomechanical factors and knee injury risk in cyclists. Study Design: Systematic review of the literature Methods: Literature searches were performed using CINAHL, Ovid, Pub Med, Scopus and SPORTDiscus. Quality of studies was assessed using the Downs and Black Scale for non-randomized trials. Results: Fourteen papers were identified that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only four studies included cyclists with knee pain. Studies were small with sample sizes ranging from 9-24 participants, and were of low to moderate quality. Biomechanical factors that may impact knee pain include cadence, power output, crank length, saddle fore/ aft position, saddle height, and foot position. Changing these factors may lead to differing effects for cyclists who experience knee pain based on specific anatomical location. Conclusion: Changes in cycling parameters or positioning on the bicycle can impact movement, forces, and muscle activity around the knee. While studies show differences across some of the extrinsic factors included in this review, there is a lack of direct association between parameters/positioning on the cycle and knee injury risk due to the limited studies examining cyclists with and without pain or injury. The results of this review can provide guidance to professionals treating cyclists with knee pain, but more research is needed.

Content: In the articles in this systemic review, no issues specific to the posterior knee were discussed. Elmer et al. 26 reported that knee flexion power increased relative to extension power as overall power output increased, 26 which may have implications for biceps femoris tendinopathy. 2 Interestingly, Dieter et al. 35 found that biceps femoris muscle activation occurred prior to semitendinosus onset in cyclists with PFP , unlike those without this anterior pain condition. More research is needed on posterior knee pain in cyclists. There are several limitations of this systematic review. Studies differed considerably in methodology, making qualitative or quantitative comparisons challenging. It is also difficult to make strong recommendations as far as the amount of change needed to decrease injury risk as studies vary in the magnitude of changes in cycling parameters and bicycle settings. Bini et al. 34 reported that even a 5% difference in saddle height can affect knee joint kinematics by 35% and joint moments by 16%; 34 yet it is unknown how these differences then translate into injury risk. There is also the lack of direct association between parameters/positioning on the cycle and injury due to limited studies examining cyclists with and without pain or injury and a lack of longitudinal studies. More research is needed to establish clear links and recommendations by manipulating parameters based on the available literature and knowledge of biomechanics impacting specific areas of the knee. Longer term effects on pain, performance, and participation should then be assessed. Another limitation is the inclusion of 2D measurements in some studies. 2D data capture can be misleading as movement outside of the sagittal plane impacts how each joint is visualized on a 2D image. In addition, 3D kinetic measurements are needed to fully understand the effects on the knee in all three planes.

This result corresponds with a study of the National Team athletes of the British cycling squad where knee injuries were the second most common injury (18%) and the main cause of total days lost for training/competition (32) . Recent review articles mainly focus on factors associated with knee pain in cyclists without using a differential diagnosis (7,25) . Despite the epidemiological evidence, little is known about the underlying clinical entities leading to knee pain in high level cyclists. Since the introduction of the term 'cyclists' knee' (31,34) , knee pain in cyclists has been assimilated to 'anterior knee pain', 'chondromalacia' or 'patellofemoral pain syndrome'. Many studies focused on knee pain in cyclists often state that patellofemoral pain syndrome is the underlying cause, without any proof of evidence (1,16) . In our experience treating high-level cyclists, the above-mentioned knee conditions are only rarely seen in these athletes. In this study we report the results of 53 cyclists' knees, outlining a comprehensive differential diagnosis of typical overuse injuries. This study describes the clinical features, physical examination and diagnostic imaging modalities of the most frequent clinical entities in our practice.

Content: Muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility protect against low back pain and/or injuries. Mechanical loading of the spine in competitive sports results in lumbar intervertebral disk degeneration. 4,8,26,33 A significantly greater proportion of swimming athletes had degenerative disk changes at one or more disk levels compared with a control group. 14 Sixty-eight percent of 56 elite swimmers (mean age, 19.6 years) and 29% of 38 recreational swimmers (mean age, 21.1 years) demonstrated degenerated disks at various levels. 18 There were no significant sex differences in the rate or among swimming strokes. 18 The main variables were training intensity, duration, and distance, suggesting that competitive swimming amplifies lumbar intervertebral disk degeneration. The L5-S1 levels are more frequently involved in elite swimmers. 18 Capaci et al concluded that 33.3% of butterfly swimmers and 22.2% of breaststroke swimmers experienced low-back pain. 9 Mutoch found a 37% incidence of pain for butterfly swimmers, while Drori et al reported a 50% incidence of pain for butterfly swimmers and 47% for breaststroke swimmers. 12,27 All swimming strokes maintain hyperextension of the lower back to achieve a streamlined position; this position is exaggerated in the 'undulating' style of breaststroke and butterfly. The high intensity and repetitiveness of these strokes load the posterior structures of the lumbar spine, which can result in spondylolysis and possible spondylolisthesis. 29 Increased intensity can increase the risk of damage. Muscle and ligament sprains can occur but settle rapidly with core stability programs and manual therapies. 15 Additional risk factors for the development of low back pain in competitive swimmers are training devices such as fins, kick boards, or pull buoys. These produce excessive hyperextension of the lumbar spine. 29

Content: This systematic review of the literature intended to assess the potential factors associated with overuse knee injuries and knee pain in cyclists. After a careful search on the main databases related to health and sports sciences, we observed that there is limited evidence on the potential mechanisms related to overuse-related pain or injury. Surprisingly, 20 narrative reviews covering, but not limited to, knee pain in cycling were found, even though the evidence is scarce in terms of the determinants of overuse knee injuries, which limits the options for prevention and treatment. Some differences were observed when comparing cyclists with and without knee pain. Cyclists with knee pain presented a medial projection of the lower limb during the power phase of cycling (from 12 to 6 o'clock positions of the crank) associated with an increased ankle dorsiflexion. 17 Although a larger medial projection of the femur in relation to the patella could lead to a reduced contact area for the patellofemoral joint, 27 this may be an adaptation to injury due to the retrospective nature of findings from Bailey et al. 17 The delayed offset of vastus lateralis and earlier offset of vastus medialis observed by Dieter et al 19 in cyclists with knee pain could also be a consequence from the medial projection of the femur. However, no data have been found in this issue when uninjured cyclists enforced a medial projection of their knees. In addition, no evidence on the control from hip adductors and/or abductors has been shown, which could help determining the rationale for the medial projection of the femur. In runners, a delayed onset of hip abductors has been associated with knee pain, 28 which provides a potential link between a delayed activation of hip abductors and the medial knee projection.

Content: Therefore, two interventions are proposed to support the cycling community. The first is incorporating neural protection and preservation among cyclists through education and training to alleviate potential problems in the future. As part of this process, it is important to undertake further research with experts in bicycle biomechanics to investigate different grip types , handlebar design, seat height , stem length , and the use of gloves , all of which influence weight distribution on the hands. Equally, cycling ergonomics and core muscle training to ensure maintenance of posture should be included more widely in educational resources. As a further intervention, a screening program for cyclists is proposed, incorporating selfadministered questionnaires like the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire , which has been investigated as a potential screening tool for carpal tunnel syndrome in a potentially high-risk cohort . Should symptoms be identified, referral to a specialist for further assessment and study can be recommended.

Content: Likewise, trunk and spine injuries could lie in errors made during training, such as excessive repetitions, explosive speeds, arching with an excessive rotational component, inadequate neuromuscular training, poor stability, core strength and posture, as well as poor /uni FB02 exibility training (2). These errors have generated an increase in the prevalence of low back pain syndrome due to repetitive and rapid arching (5). Some movements performed during warm-ups have also required that the lumbar spine be maintained in hyperextension, as this achieves a streamlined body position; this can place excessive load in the lower back (27). Consequently, teaching, correcting and maintaining good swimming technique, modifying the frequency, strength, speed, and degree of hyperextension in the acute phase (5), as well as strengthening the lumbopelvic complex area (30), could help reduce the risk of injuries, especially in the trunk and lumbar spine of artistic swimmers (2, 31). Therefore, physiotherapists and physical exercise professionals should integrate this methodology into their training programs to improve the sports performance of swimmers and there by prevent possible injuries (32).

Content: With the increase in recreational and competitive cycling, cyclists are experiencing more overuse injuries related to repetitive loading. 1 Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury. 1 Intrinsic factors are inherent to the cyclist and include fitness level as well as anatomical alignment of the lower extremities. 1 Extrinsic factors are generally associated with factors external to the cyclist such as equipment, riding technique, and training. 1 The knee is the most common joint impacted by cycling overuse injuries in recreational and professional cyclists. 1,2 Knee pain is reported to affect 40-60% of recreational cyclists and 3662% of professional cyclists. 1,3,4 Anterior knee pain is the most common, which is likely due to patellofemoral pain, patellar tendinopathy, or quadriceps tendinopathy. 1,3-5 Factors that may cause anterior knee pain include increased pressure due to hill climbing, heavy workloads, increased training, altered patellar tracking, or by a combination of factors. 1,3,4 Many risk factors can contribute to the problem such as altered patellar position, decreased flexibility, increased quadriceps (Q) angle, muscle imbalances, and various limb torsional and foot deformities. 1,6 In a review article, Johnston reported that cycling cadence and workload impact moments around the knee, which may contribute to knee injury at higher effort levels. 7 Increasing knee flexion angle can increase forces impacting the knee 8 while co-contraction of the knee flexors and extensors can decrease them. 9 Thus the interaction of these variables as well as power output and cycling duration may be important in understanding cyclists who are at greater risk of injury due to loading.

Content: Cycling is an activity that tends to be prescribed often in the presence of injury due to its low impact nature. A typical cyclist however, will perform something in the order of 5000-6000 pedal strokes per hour and as a result, overuse injuries in cycling are very common. In a survey of elite cyclists, the most common injury experienced was low back pain with over 40% reporting suffering from back pain but losing only 2-3 days per year as a result. The next most common complaint was knee pain with 32% of riders experiencing knee pain, however riders tended to lose much more time, typically 10-12 days of training as a result of their knee injury. Due to the high volume of repetition, cycling provides plenty of scope for magnifying minor biomechanical issues, resulting in overuse injuries, particularly at the knee. These biomechanical issues may result from either poor strength, technique or bike set up. <!-- image --> Cycling incorporates all of the major leg muscles at different phases of the pedal stroke. The optimal bike set up is one in which all of these muscles are in their ideal length to generate power at the point of the pedal stroke when they are the most active. An optimal position on the bike should allow for the most efficient balance of forces on the body in order to prevent injury not only in the knee, but in other areas such as the hips and back. Cycling predominantly involves use of the hips, knee and ankle joints. While the hip and ankle joint are designed to work in a range of positions, the knee functions essentially as a hinged joint, designed only for repetitive loading in the one plane.

Content: Studies were included if they presented results from original (i.e., experimental) studies, which resulted in the removal of review articles and epidemiological studies. Studies had to include, preferably, but not limited to, recreational and/or competitive cyclists with or without knee pain. We opted for including studies that did not assess cyclists with injury or pain on the knees but assessed injury-related outcomes that could potentially explain the reason for why cyclists have knee pain. The reason for this option was also an attempt to expand the understanding on what could trigger knee pain in cyclists (e.g., excessive compressive force at the patellofemoral joint). In addition to that was the potential reduced number of experimental studies assessing the determinants of knee pain in cyclists that sustained cycling as an exercise and/or training. However, due to the aim of our study, articles that assessed non-cyclists with knee injuries potentially not related to bicycle pedaling were removed. Studies that had focus on triathletes or any combined training mode were also excluded due to potential carryover effects from other training activities (e.g., swimming and running). Finally, articles that assessed traumatic (acute) injuries in cycling were also excluded.

Ten studies with focus on the epidemiology of overuse injuries were also separated to be discussed in terms of the incidence of injuries in cycling. Eleven articles were deemed eligible for full text appraisal but 1 was not assessed due to difficulties in retrieving the full text and the original language being German 16 (Figure 1). Results are presented in tables with information on sample size, study design, methods, outcomes, and main findings for each study. Studies involved generally the assessment of biomechanical outcomes associated with knee pain in cyclists. Four studies 17-20 involved the assessment of cyclists (mostly recreational) reporting knee pain related to bicycle pedaling or providing medical evidence for knee pain (e.g., MRI). Two articles involved case studies of individual cyclists who had cycling-related knee pain. 21,22 One study 21 did not assess bicycle pedaling and was limited to clinical description of symptoms and imaging scan. Four studies 23-26 did not assess cyclists with injury or pain on the knees but assessed injuryrelated outcomes that could potentially explain the reason for why cyclists develop knee pain (Table 2). Among the outcomes, authors reported kinematics (e.g., knee flexion angle), kinetics (e.g., knee joint moments), muscular activation (e.g., surface electromyography), and perceived comfort gathered from stationary cycling trials and others acquired from various tasks (e.g., isokinetic dynamometry).

Content: This review was limited to some extent. The first limitation was the assessment of articles by authors from the same research group, which constrains the quality assessment to similar standards. An additional limitation was related to the quantity and quality of the studies. As previously discussed, no study used prospective designs to assess factors related to knee pain and injuries in cycling. Few studies included cyclists with existing knee pain or injury. Therefore, the conclusions of this systematic review are associated with the limitations of the evidence available. Future studies should be prospective in nature to understand the potential determinants of knee pain and injury in cyclists. The partition of the cohort by type of injury would then allow a more comprehensive understanding of how each component of the knee joint (e.g., patellofemoral) is affected by injury.

Content: Hip pain in the cyclist is typically caused by trochanteric bursitis and iliopsoas tendinitis. In both cases, the exacerbating factor usually is riding with the bike seat too high. This results in undue tension on both the ITB and the iliopsoas tendon. The bike seat should be lowered to allow 30 to 35 of knee flexion at the bottom of the pedal cycle. Nonsurgical management involves stretching of the respective structure, along with rest, ice, NSAIDs, and local steroid injection, as needed. Iliopsoas tendinitis also may be closely connected to low back pain; a tight psoas muscle can inhibit the transversus abdominis, internal obliquus, and gluteus maximus. 22,23 This, in turn, causes decreased hip mobility. Physical therapy may be indicated to address alignment of the pelvis and sacrum. The tight muscular structures may be released with therapeutic techniques such as trigger point massage or injection. Additionally, pelvic alignment may be corrected with muscle energy techniques. 22,23 in training intensity or misalignment of the lower extremity, leading to excessive pronation of the foot. It is thought that the pronated position of the foot, in conjunction with sudden increases in activity, leads to traction-induced periostitis of the medial tibia. 24,25 Magnetic resonance imaging and a bone scan may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Management usually involves activity modification (specifically, nonimpact activity to maintain cardiovascular fitness until the pain is resolved), along with NSAIDs, stretching, and antipronation taping to correct excessive pronation of the foot. 26 Strengthening exercises may include isometrics and foot intrinsics, with progression to eccentric dorsiflexion for deceleration control of the anterior tibialis. It is important to reestablish distance before speed.

Content: An alternative scenario would involve a differential activation of hip adductor (e.g., adductor magnus) and hip external rotators (e.g., gluteus maximus). This differential activation, in favor of the hip adductors, could lead to an enhanced medial projection of the knee. Bini et al 29 observed that an enforced hip adduction (commonly observed in time trial and track cycling) leads to an increased activation of hip adductors and larger forces applied to the pedals. 30 Interestingly, Ericson et al 31 observed that an enforced medial projection of the knees also leads to an increased lateral shear force at the knee joint, which could be expected to trigger knee injuries. However, no evidence has been provided on this link. Although the relationship between differential activation from hip muscles is lacking, clinicians could assess the ranges of motion and mobility for the hip joint of cyclists to evaluate whether changes in muscle force and mobility could be triggering the excessive medial projection of the knees. Even though low saddle height has been previously related to increased knee loads (which could trigger knee pain and injury), cyclists with overuse-related pain did not present lower saddle heights or increased patellofemoral <!-- image --> Powered by TCPDF (w w.tcpdf.org) Table 2 Summary of findings from studies selected for appraisal in this systematic review

Content: Given the rising popularity of cycling internationally, healthcare professionals and cyclists must work together to raise awareness of median and ulnar neuropathies among this active population. Preventive measures, prompt diagnosis, and treatment can potentially limit the morbidity associated with these pathologies. This evaluation highlights the need for further work, particularly when screening cyclists. Hopefully, this work will enable positive symptoms to be identified early rather than attributed to being part of the cycling experience.

Content: This study gives a comprehensive diagnostic overview of cycling overuse injuries of the knee. In contrast to many other studies the patellofemoral pain syndrome, although often cited as the prime cause of anterior knee pain in cyclists, did not occur in our patient cohort. Many studies have reported the occurrence of knee overuse injuries in cycling. However, only few outlined the possible underlying causes of knee overuse injuries (6,8,15,23,38,39) . Table II gives an overview of the proposed differential diagnoses in literature. Our results showed that for a total of 53 elite cyclists' knees 7 different types of overuse injuries could be found besides the patellofemoral pain syndrome. In our experience over years dealing with high level cyclists, patellofemoral joint pathology is a rather uncommon cause of knee pain in high level cyclists and should only be determined when confirmed by medical imaging. In the absence of patellofemoral abnormalities on medical imaging, other possible causes have to be considered. Table 3 gives an overview of the typical features for each syndrome with clinical examination, diagnostic imaging and preferred treatment. Although a possible explanation for the absence of patellofemoral pain syndrome in this study cohort could be the sample size or selection bias, we feel that there are significant contradictions in the Table II. - Overview of studies reporting overuse injuries of the knee in cyclists.

Content: Cycling is an increasingly popular recreational and competitive activity, and cycling-related injuries are becoming more common. Many common cycling injuries of the lower extremity are preventable. These include knee pain, patellar quadriceps tendinitis, iliotibial band syndrome, hip pain, medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, compartment syndrome, numbness of the foot, and metatarsalgia. Injury is caused by a combination of inadequate preparation, inappropriate equipment, poor technique, and overuse. Nonsurgical management may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, ice, a reduction in training intensity, orthotics, night splints, and physical therapy. Injury prevention should be the focus, with particular attention to bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, proper rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training. F rom November2001through October 2002, approximately 33 million US residents rode a bicycle an average of 6 days a month, for an average of &gt;1 hour on a typical day. 1 The number of bicycling trips taken between 1990 and 1995 doubled following implementation of the National Bicycle and Walking Study ; 2 this trend continues. The increased number of bicyclists has led to increased numbers of associated injuries. 2,3 Traumatic injury occurs as a result of overuse injury from repetitive motion and from unexpected motion. Overuse injury is caused by repetitive loading of bone, joint, and soft tissue with inadequate recovery time. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury potential. Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique. Lower limb injury can be sustained by both the elite cyclist and the casual cyclist.

Content: An alternative scenario would involve a differential activation of hip adductor (e.g., adductor magnus) and hip external rotators (e.g., gluteus maximus). This differential activation, in favor of the hip adductors, could lead to an enhanced medial projection of the knee. Bini et al 29 observed that an enforced hip adduction (commonly observed in time trial and track cycling) leads to an increased activation of hip adductors and larger forces applied to the pedals. 30 Interestingly, Ericson et al 31 observed that an enforced medial projection of the knees also leads to an increased lateral shear force at the knee joint, which could be expected to trigger knee injuries. However, no evidence has been provided on this link. Although the relationship between differential activation from hip muscles is lacking, clinicians could assess the ranges of motion and mobility for the hip joint of cyclists to evaluate whether changes in muscle force and mobility could be triggering the excessive medial projection of the knees.

Content: There are several limitations of this systematic review. Studies differed considerably in methodology, making qualitative or quantitative comparisons challenging. It is also difficult to make strong recommendations as far as the amount of change needed to decrease injury risk as studies vary in the magnitude of changes in cycling parameters and bicycle settings. Bini et al. 34 reported that even a 5% difference in saddle height can affect knee joint kinematics by 35% and joint moments by 16%; 34 yet it is unknown how these differences then translate into injury risk. There is also the lack of direct association between parameters/positioning on the cycle and injury due to limited studies examining cyclists with and without pain or injury and a lack of longitudinal studies. More research is needed to establish clear links and recommendations by manipulating parameters based on the available literature and knowledge of biomechanics impacting specific areas of the knee. Longer term effects on pain, performance, and participation should then be assessed. Another limitation is the inclusion of 2D measurements in some studies. 2D data capture can be misleading as movement outside of the sagittal plane impacts how each joint is visualized on a 2D image. In addition, 3D kinetic measurements are needed to fully understand the effects on the knee in all three planes.

Content: Several knee structures are potentially at risk for overuse injury with cycling due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most common causes of knee pain in cyclists, resulting in anterior knee pain. 5 Female gender is a risk factor for PFP, 10 and PFP is more common in female cyclists. 11 An additional risk factor is reduced quadriceps strength, 10 which may cause the greatest prevalence of PFP during preseason training in cyclists. 4 Additional associated factors with PFP in cyclists include excessive varus knee moments during the power stroke, 12 excessive valgus knee alignment, 5 repetitive loading of the patella, 13 weak gluteal muscles, 5 increased Q angles, 11 excessive patellar lateral tilt, 5 and excessive foot pronation. 5 Patellar and quadriceps tendinopathies are additional causes of anterior knee pain in cyclists, 5 which are caused by chronic repetitive overload of tendons during quadriceps contractions. 14,15 Iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome is the most common cause of lateral knee pain in cyclists. 2 Proposed mechanisms for ITB syndrome are compression of fat beneath the ITB at the lateral femoral epicondyle or friction of the ITB as it moves across the lateral femoral epicondyle during repetitive knee flexion and extension. 2,11,16 When the knee reaches 20-30 of flexion, the ITB passes over the lateral femoral epicondyle, 17,18 creating an impingement zone for fat and an adventitial bursa. 2,5,11 ITB syndrome is likely caused by increased tibial internal rotation, ITB tightness, inward pointing of toes on the pedals, increased hip adduction, a bicycle saddle position that is too high, and rapid increase in mileage. 1,2,5,16,19 Medial knee injuries seen in cyclists include medial collateral ligament bursitis, plica syndrome, pes anserine syndrome and medial meniscus tear

Content: Cycling has become a very popular sport recently, and it continues to gain popularity. It is a frequently employed method of recreation, rehabilitation, and even competition. Often in the course of rehabilitation or recreation, the goal is to strengthen one structure while minimizing stress on another. Using the information provided, it becomes easier to identify which anatomical structures are stressed and when they are active. There appears to be an intricate interaction of leg muscles during cycling, as the muscles show overlapping periods of activity. Cycling efficiency may even be influenced by some of the biomechanical factors discussed. The data presented on seat height, stating high seat heights cause a greater stress to the ACL and meniscotibial ligaments, pose a dilemma for the physical therapist treating a patient who has undergone ACL reconstruction and has some patellofemoral pain and/or crepitus. Keeping the seat high may help decrease patellofemoral pressures (although this has yet to be documented), while potentially increasing the stress on the ACL. Evidence indicates that increasing the seat height decreases the compressive forces at the tibiofemoral joint, although such stresses are small compared to the tibiofemoral stresses in level walking (2-4 times bodyweight), stairclimbing (4 times bodyweight), or rising from a chair (3-7 times bodyweight) (7).

The latter injuries are more consistent and predictable. Fitness, cycling technique, and lower limb anatomy often contribute to injury that results from repetitive motion and overuse. Injury is especially common in the cyclist with poor technique. Prevention of these injuries is centered around several basic principles, such as proper bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, correct rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training regimens.

Content: The rehabilitation of cyclists with knee pain or overuse injury requires a full understanding of the mechanism that Powered by TCPDF (w w.tcpdf.org) triggers the overuse injury. In the case of the knee joint, it is difficult to establish conclusive recommendations because only a couple of patterns have been observed to differ between injured and uninjured cyclists. The medial projection of the knee and the changes in activation for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles could indicate 2 main options. The first would involve an assessment of force and mobility for hip adductors and abductors, which could provide evidence of potential imbalance of a given muscle group. However, we must keep in mind that this is very speculative given there is a lack of evidence in this area. The second option would involve the assessment of activation of vastus medialis in relation to vastus lateralis, which could help controlling the position of the patella in relation to the femur. Although patients with delayed onset of vastus medialis could be more prone to develop or sustain anterior knee pain, the literature is not conclusive in this area. 35 Therefore, treatment involving an enhanced activation of the vastus medialis should be a secondary option.

Content: Cycling parameters (i.e., cadence and power output) and bicycle fit settings have differing effects on kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity around the knee. Few studies compared cyclists with and without knee pain, so injury risk can only be surmised based on the results of biomechanical studies that examine cyclists without injury or pain. There is also a lack of longitudinal studies to assess the effects of altering parameters on knee injury and pain. Thus, causation cannot be determined. Studies examining cycling kinetics indicate that various stresses are imparted on the knee based on a variety of kinetic variables. Vertical and anterior pedal reaction forces increase at higher cadences, 30 and vertical and medial pedal reaction forces increase at higher power outputs. 30 Tibiofemoral peak anterior shear forces were found to be increased at higher saddle heights, 34 and ankle inversion increased peak vertical forces. 12 These findings are in partial agreement with an earlier study by Ericson and Nisell, 37 which reported that higher saddle heights significantly increased tibiofemoral anterior shear forces, but decreased tibiofemoral compressive forces. The findings of the studies in this systematic review and earlier studies have implications for loading of the knee joint during cycling and suggest that lower cadences, lower workloads, a higher saddle height, and foot eversion might be preferred for cyclists with knee pain due to tibiofemoral compressive joint loading, such as with medial tibiofemoral OA. In contrast, cyclists with anterior cruciate ligament injury or reconstruction may benefit from a

Content: Although mention of protective factors in review level evidence did not exist at the time of this evidence review, findings from original research previously described (under modifiable risk factors) signify load management as a viable target for mitigating injury risk in soccer. For example, an in-season relative load measure of acute to chronic workload ratio of 1 to 1.25 significantly reduced injuries among youth players , and a reduced absolute load significantly reduced injuries among youth and adult professional players [39, 40]. Additionally, current evidence suggests that improved neuromuscular capacity and control, including increased quadriceps, hamstring, hip flexor strength, and movement control are protective against injuries among soccer players [9, 26, 29, 42, 43].

Content: The rehabilitation of cyclists with knee pain or overuse injury requires a full understanding of the mechanism that triggers the overuse injury. In the case of the knee joint, it is difficult to establish conclusive recommendations because only a couple of patterns have been observed to differ between injured and uninjured cyclists. The medial projection of the knee and the changes in activation for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles could indicate 2 main options. The first would involve an assessment of force and mobility for hip adductors and abductors, which could provide evidence of potential imbalance of a given muscle group. However, we must keep in mind that this is very speculative given there is a lack of evidence in this area. The second option would involve the assessment of activation of vastus medialis in relation to vastus lateralis, which could help controlling the position of the patella in relation to the femur. Although patients with delayed onset of vastus medialis could be more prone to develop or sustain anterior knee pain, the literature is not conclusive in this area. 35 Therefore, treatment involving an enhanced activation of the vastus medialis should be a secondary option.

The pressure between the patella and the femur is dictated by muscle forces (which increases at low saddle heights) and by contact areas between cartilages (which also increases in larger knee flexions - that is, low saddle heights). 32 Therefore, there seems to be a plateau in patellofemoral pressure at saddle heights close to 100% 4% of the trochanteric height to the floor. 18 In addition, Wheeler et al 20 did not observe consistent differences in internal/external rotation moments at the tibiofemoral joint, which was initially anticipated to increase the stress in the knee joint soft tissues (e.g., meniscus). Although largely considered as a trigger of knee injuries, a limited 'float' (i.e., rotation) of the cleat in relation to the pedal could not lead to overuse knee injuries. Theoretically, by increasing the 'float' between the cleat and the pedal, the rotation moments could be reduced at the knee joint. However, a prospective link between increased float and reductions in knee pain is lacking.

This pain is caused by increased pressure across the patellofemoral joint, poor patellofemoral tracking, or a combination of both. Excessive pressure across the patellofemoral joint is caused by hill climbing, riding in high gears, and a too-slow cadence. 3 The increased Cadence refers to the number of times the pedal makes a 360 turn each minute. A cyclist should be able to comfortably maintain a cadence of 70 to 80 rpm.

Content: Ok so now you have your bike set up just right, so problems solved? Not quite, the correct loading and tracking of the knee on the bike also relies on strength and technique. A common issue resulting in overload to the knee is excessive plantar flexion of the ankle through the pedal stroke. The ankle should remain in a relatively neutral position throughout the stroke, plantar flexion is the toe down position of the foot and ankle. Excessive plantarflexion has the effect of increasing the crank length or decreasing the saddle height at the top of the stroke and decreasing crank length or increasing saddle height at the bottom of the stroke. Another common issue is allowing the knee to drift in or out through the pedal stroke. As previously stated, the knee is basically a hinge joint deigned to operate in a forward plane with repetitive movements. Any repeated rotation in the knee as a result of either medial or lateral drift of the knee, will result in excessive force on both the meniscus (cartilage inside the knee) as well as on the tissue around the patella. Commonly this medial or lateral drift is related to poor strength and control of the deeper muscles of the hip joint.

Excessive pressure across the patellofemoral joint is caused by hill climbing, riding in high gears, and a too-slow cadence. 3 The increased pressure results in excessive shear and compression of articular cartilage, leading to chondromalacia. Patellofemoral malalignment also may cause patellofemoral syndrome as a result of the uneven distribution of pressures across the joint surface (Figure 5). Risk factors for malalignment include high or lateral position of the patella; dysplasia of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) muscle; a large quadriceps angle; inflexibility of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles; and limb deformities, including femoral anteversion, external tibial torsion, and hyperpronated feet with hindfoot valgus. 13,14 Improper bicycle fit also can lead Normal (A) and abnormal (B) patellofemoral alignment. <!-- image --> to patellofemoral syndrome. When the bicycle seat is positioned too low or too far forward, excessive pressure is experienced across the patellofemoral joint. These positions result in excessive flexion of the knee, leading to a more perpendicular vector force across the joint. 10 In addition to proper seat position, adequate training can help minimize the incidence of patellofemoral syndrome. Quadriceps strengthening focused on the VMO, along with stretching of the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemiussoleus complex, may help improve patellofemoral alignment. Another method of strengthening is electrical muscle stimulation, which helps establish the desired 1:1 ratio between the VMOandthevastuslateralis (VL) muscles during quadriceps contraction.

Content: This systematic review of the literature intended to assess the potential factors associated with overuse knee injuries and knee pain in cyclists. After a careful search on the main databases related to health and sports sciences, we observed that there is limited evidence on the potential mechanisms related to overuse-related pain or injury. Surprisingly, 20 narrative reviews covering, but not limited to, knee pain in cycling were found, even though the evidence is scarce in terms of the determinants of overuse knee injuries, which limits the options for prevention and treatment. Some differences were observed when comparing cyclists with and without knee pain. Cyclists with knee pain presented a medial projection of the lower limb during the power phase of cycling (from 12 to 6 o'clock positions of the crank) associated with an increased ankle dorsiflexion. 17 Although a larger medial projection of the femur in relation to the patella could lead to a reduced contact area for the patellofemoral joint, 27 this may be an adaptation to injury due to the retrospective nature of findings from Bailey et al. 17 The delayed offset of vastus lateralis and earlier offset of vastus medialis observed by Dieter et al 19 in cyclists with knee pain could also be a consequence from the medial projection of the femur. However, no data have been found in this issue when uninjured cyclists enforced a medial projection of their knees. In addition, no evidence on the control from hip adductors and/or abductors has been shown, which could help determining the rationale for the medial projection of the femur. In runners, a delayed onset of hip abductors has been associated with knee pain, 28 which provides a potential link between a delayed activation of hip abductors and the medial knee projection.

Content: Medial and lateral regions of the knee are also susceptible to injury. Coronal plane forces are affected by foot position, with eversion lowering peak varus and internal axial moments and increasing vastus medialis activation compared to inversion. 12 For people with medial knee OA, rotating the shank to increase toe-in angle reduced peak knee adduction angles, with no impact on peak knee abduction moments. 36 Gardner et al. 36 hypothesized that an alignment change with increased toe-in foot position would decrease the frontal plane moment arm of the pedal reaction force, which would decrease knee abduction moments. As competitive cyclists and people with knee OA differ in knee alignment, findings may be specific to these populations. One study examined the impact of saddle height on ITB syndrome and reported that a lower saddle height that increased minimum knee flexion angle to greater than 30 kept the ITB out of the impingement zone. 31 For cyclists at risk for ITB pain, a lower seat height may also be desirable by reducing compensatory lateral pelvic motion 31 that can increase stress to the ITB.

For instance, the association with other sports activities, 3 bicycle misalignment, 4 inexperience or lack of pre-ride conditioning, 8 and long distances ride 10 were among the suggested triggers for knee pain. Dettori and Norvel, 11 discussed some possible mechanisms for non-traumatic injuries and prevention plan. As an example, for patellofemoral inflammation, the saddle could be too low and/or too far forward and most authors have encouraged to follow preventive adjustments, like proper saddle adjustment, the use of orthotics, cleat adjustment, and reduction in gear ratio (especially early in the season), among others. 1,2,12,13 However, only a few of these strategies have been tested experimentally, and most of the advocated recommendations lack of solid evidence that could be important in preventing injuries. Sabeti-Aschraf et al 14 investigated 169 competitive mountain bikers and correlated their injury occurrence with the configuration of their bicycles. They found that 87 had overuse injuries after a race (Babenberger Trophy) and observed a significant correlation between inadequate saddle-pedal distance and knee pain ( p &lt; 0.04). They concluded that bicycle adjustments have a direct impact on the incidence of overuse injuries in the competitive mountain bike cyclist. Conversely, Dahlquist et al 7 declared in their study that flexibility, strength, and bike fit measures did not predict injury and concluded that injury risk and prevention strategies need additional studies. There are a minimum of 20 review articles published suggesting how to prevent and treat knee pain and injuries despite lack evidence supporting the current advocated practices. With this in mind, the determinants of overuse injuries and pain in cyclists that are supported by evidence remain unclear.

Content: Congruency and stability of the knee are contingent on the relative function and orientation of adjacent joints. In other words, the ankle, foot and pelvis are directly responsible for what happens at the knee. Symmetrical pelvic obliquity and rotation contribute to proper knee function, but may be compromised by improper ankle and/or foot biomechanics. Foot and ankle biomechanics are impacted by many factors, including vertical axis proximity to the femur in the frontal plane, and may impact knee and hip function. Assuming optimal pelvis, ankle and foot orientations and function, bi-lateral medial knee pain typically accompanies an excessively wide pedaling base with similar features laterally when too narrow. Of course there are many exceptions to this rule, including people who demonstrate abnormal kinematics without symptoms, but we are speaking in general terms. Based on these findings, I expected fat biking to host an epidemic of medial knee problems. In truth, the incidence of knee related issues for fat bike clients is higher, but not sufficient for predictive value. I expect this is due to the dynamic features of fat biking and reduced pedaling torque necessary to maintain traction riding off-road and in snowy-conditions. Regardless of symptoms, compromised biomechanics that can increase the risk for injury or have cumulative negative effects on knee integrity. <!-- image --> Biomechanics of a Wide Pedaling Base Joint Forces Flexion and compressive tibiofemoral loads are very low when cycling, and patellofemoral compression has more to do with saddle height/setback than pedaling stance.

Content: Cycling parameters (i.e., cadence and power output) and bicycle fit settings have differing effects on kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity around the knee. Few studies compared cyclists with and without knee pain, so injury risk can only be surmised based on the results of biomechanical studies that examine cyclists without injury or pain. There is also a lack of longitudinal studies to assess the effects of altering parameters on knee injury and pain. Thus, causation cannot be determined. Studies examining cycling kinetics indicate that various stresses are imparted on the knee based on a variety of kinetic variables. Vertical and anterior pedal reaction forces increase at higher cadences, 30 and vertical and medial pedal reaction forces increase at higher power outputs. 30 Tibiofemoral peak anterior shear forces were found to be increased at higher saddle heights, 34 and ankle inversion increased peak vertical forces. 12 These findings are in partial agreement with an earlier study by Ericson and Nisell, 37 which reported that higher saddle heights significantly increased tibiofemoral anterior shear forces, but decreased tibiofemoral compressive forces. The findings of the studies in this systematic review and earlier studies have implications for loading of the knee joint during cycling and suggest that lower cadences, lower workloads, a higher saddle height, and foot eversion might be preferred for cyclists with knee pain due to tibiofemoral compressive joint loading, such as with medial tibiofemoral OA.

The increased number of bicyclists has led to increased numbers of associated injuries. 2,3 Traumatic injury occurs as a result of overuse injury from repetitive motion and from unexpected motion. Overuse injury is caused by repetitive loading of bone, joint, and soft tissue with inadequate recovery time. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury potential. Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique.

Content: Cycling is an activity that tends to be prescribed often in the presence of injury due to its low impact nature. A typical cyclist however, will perform something in the order of 5000-6000 pedal strokes per hour and as a result, overuse injuries in cycling are very common. In a survey of elite cyclists, the most common injury experienced was low back pain with over 40% reporting suffering from back pain but losing only 2-3 days per year as a result. The next most common complaint was knee pain with 32% of riders experiencing knee pain, however riders tended to lose much more time, typically 10-12 days of training as a result of their knee injury. Due to the high volume of repetition, cycling provides plenty of scope for magnifying minor biomechanical issues, resulting in overuse injuries, particularly at the knee. These biomechanical issues may result from either poor strength, technique or bike set up. <!-- image --> Cycling incorporates all of the major leg muscles at different phases of the pedal stroke. The optimal bike set up is one in which all of these muscles are in their ideal length to generate power at the point of the pedal stroke when they are the most active. An optimal position on the bike should allow for the most efficient balance of forces on the body in order to prevent injury not only in the knee, but in other areas such as the hips and back. Cycling predominantly involves use of the hips, knee and ankle joints. While the hip and ankle joint are designed to work in a range of positions, the knee functions essentially as a hinged joint, designed only for repetitive loading in the one plane.

Our results show that friction related overuse injuries are a frequent and probably underrated cause of knee pain in high level cyclists. Patellofemoral pain syndrome, though often suggested as a primary diagnosis in the literature, seems to be unusual in high level cycling. Thorough history, clinical examination and additional imaging techniques provide the ultimate key to a prompt and correct diagnosis. Successful treatment of the specific type of overuse injury will increase the recovery rate and ensure rapid return to pain-free cycling activities.

The more posterior the angle of the tibia, the greater the tendency of tlle femur to slide posteriorly and the greater the load on the ACL (14). The muscles acting on the knee can modify these forces, and since the seat height can influence the muscle actions, the seat height can affect the stresses on the knee ligaments. By varying the seat height and pedal position, the knee ligaments can be relieved of harmful stresses. Particular attention to protecting the knee ligaments from stress is important in the early phases of rehabilitation but also comes into play later in recovery when cyclic stressing of the ligaments may help increase the ligaments' strength.

Content: The development of Runner's Knee can be attributed to a range of factors: - Overuse and Repetitive Stress : Activities that involve a lot of knee bending - like jogging, squatting, and biking - can lead to overuse injuries in the knee. Repetitive stress on the knee joint can irritate the nerves of the patella and strain the tendons. - Muscle Imbalance and Weakness : Weak quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip muscles can contribute to Runner's Knee. These imbalances can cause the patella to track improperly along the femoral groove, leading to increased stress and pain. - Biomechanical Issues : Problems with foot alignment, including flat feet or overpronation, can affect the way forces are transmitted through the leg, impacting the knee joint. - Direct Trauma to the Knee : A direct hit to the knee can lead to Runner's Knee, as it can disturb the alignment or the balance of forces on the patella. Understanding these causes is crucial for both prevention and treatment. It's important to note that Runner's Knee is typically more common in females than males, possibly due to differences in muscle strength and pelvic width. As physiotherapy professionals, our expertise in diagnosing and managing conditions like Runner's Knee is backed by years of experience and ongoing education. We understand the intricacies of knee pain and are committed to providing our patients with the most effective, evidencebased treatment strategies.

Content: Background: The knee is susceptible to injury during cycling due to the repetitive nature of the activity while generating torque on the pedal. Knee pain is the most common overuse related injury reported by cyclists, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors can contribute to the development of knee pain. Purpose: Due to the potential for various knee injuries, this purpose of this systematic review of the literature was to determine the association between biomechanical factors and knee injury risk in cyclists. Study Design: Systematic review of the literature Methods: Literature searches were performed using CINAHL, Ovid, Pub Med, Scopus and SPORTDiscus. Quality of studies was assessed using the Downs and Black Scale for non-randomized trials. Results: Fourteen papers were identified that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only four studies included cyclists with knee pain. Studies were small with sample sizes ranging from 9-24 participants, and were of low to moderate quality. Biomechanical factors that may impact knee pain include cadence, power output, crank length, saddle fore/ aft position, saddle height, and foot position. Changing these factors may lead to differing effects for cyclists who experience knee pain based on specific anatomical location. Conclusion: Changes in cycling parameters or positioning on the bicycle can impact movement, forces, and muscle activity around the knee. While studies show differences across some of the extrinsic factors included in this review, there is a lack of direct association between parameters/positioning on the cycle and knee injury risk due to the limited studies examining cyclists with and without pain or injury. The results of this review can provide guidance to professionals treating cyclists with knee pain, but more research is needed.

Content: Hip pain in the cyclist is typically caused by trochanteric bursitis and iliopsoas tendinitis. In both cases, the exacerbating factor usually is riding with the bike seat too high. This results in undue tension on both the ITB and the iliopsoas tendon. The bike seat should be lowered to allow 30 to 35 of knee flexion at the bottom of the pedal cycle. Nonsurgical management involves stretching of the respective structure, along with rest, ice, NSAIDs, and local steroid injection, as needed. Iliopsoas tendinitis also may be closely connected to low back pain; a tight psoas muscle can inhibit the transversus abdominis, internal obliquus, and gluteus maximus. 22,23 This, in turn, causes decreased hip mobility. Physical therapy may be indicated to address alignment of the pelvis and sacrum. The tight muscular structures may be released with therapeutic techniques such as trigger point massage or injection. Additionally, pelvic alignment may be corrected with muscle energy techniques. 22,23 in training intensity or misalignment of the lower extremity, leading to excessive pronation of the foot. It is thought that the pronated position of the foot, in conjunction with sudden increases in activity, leads to traction-induced periostitis of the medial tibia. 24,25 Magnetic resonance imaging and a bone scan may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Management usually involves activity modification (specifically, nonimpact activity to maintain cardiovascular fitness until the pain is resolved), along with NSAIDs, stretching, and antipronation taping to correct excessive pronation of the foot. 26 Strengthening exercises may include isometrics and foot intrinsics, with progression to eccentric dorsiflexion for deceleration control of the anterior tibialis.

Secondly, the athletes did not land their feet properly after the jump, and the knee joint was subjected to great stress. Causes the knee joint to twist. The above two points are the main reasons for the acute injury of the knee joint during the actual combat. The reason of chronic knee joint injury is mostly due to accumulated sports wear and tear, which has an irreversible impact on the knee joint. It is common that the meniscus is seriously worn, resulting in insufficient cushioning at the joint of the thigh and calf. Chronic knee joint injury is mainly related to the consumption of knee joint. The more serious chronic knee joint injury requires the replacement of artificial tissues by medical means. There are also many objective factors affecting knee joint sports injury. First of all, there is a lack of necessary warm-up links before the start of sports. When the preparatory activities before sports are insufficient, the flexibility of their own joints does not meet the needs of sports, which may greatly cause sports injuries at joints in the process of sports. When self warm-up activities are fully guaranteed, even if sports risks occur, the severity of sports risks can be effectively reduced. Secondly, too long exercise time and too much exercise frequency are also indirect causes of knee joint injury. When a sport is over, all parts of the body tissues, joints and muscles are in a state of fatigue. If you don't get enough rest, continue to exercise. The body will be overloaded. It greatly increases the risk of sports injury. In addition, the knee joint bears all the gravity above the knee of the body. Under fatigue, the knee joint cannot bear the movement with this gravity intensity. Once the risk occurs in the fatigue state, the severity of the risk is relatively high. Lack of adequate self-protection awareness is also an indirect cause of knee joint sports injury

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most common causes of knee pain in cyclists, resulting in anterior knee pain. 5 Female gender is a risk factor for PFP, 10 and PFP is more common in female cyclists. 11 An additional risk factor is reduced quadriceps strength, 10 which may cause the greatest prevalence of PFP during preseason training in cyclists. 4 Additional associated factors with PFP in cyclists include excessive varus knee moments during the power stroke, 12 excessive valgus knee alignment, 5 repetitive loading of the patella, 13 weak gluteal muscles, 5 increased Q angles, 11 excessive patellar lateral tilt, 5 and excessive foot pronation. 5 Patellar and quadriceps tendinopathies are additional causes of anterior knee pain in cyclists, 5 which are caused by chronic repetitive overload of tendons during quadriceps contractions. 14,15 Iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome is the most common cause of lateral knee pain in cyclists. 2 Proposed mechanisms for ITB syndrome are compression of fat beneath the ITB at the lateral femoral epicondyle or friction of the ITB as it moves across the lateral femoral epicondyle during repetitive knee flexion and extension. 2,11,16 When the knee reaches 20-30 of flexion, the ITB passes over the lateral femoral epicondyle, 17,18 creating an impingement zone for fat and an adventitial bursa. 2,5,11 ITB syndrome is likely caused by increased tibial internal rotation, ITB tightness, inward pointing of toes on the pedals, increased hip adduction, a bicycle saddle position that is too high, and rapid increase in mileage. 1,2,5,16,19 Medial knee injuries seen in cyclists include medial collateral ligament bursitis, plica syndrome, pes anserine syndrome and medial meniscus tear

Content: There are several limitations of this systematic review. Studies differed considerably in methodology, making qualitative or quantitative comparisons challenging. It is also difficult to make strong recommendations as far as the amount of change needed to decrease injury risk as studies vary in the magnitude of changes in cycling parameters and bicycle settings. Bini et al. 34 reported that even a 5% difference in saddle height can affect knee joint kinematics by 35% and joint moments by 16%; 34 yet it is unknown how these differences then translate into injury risk. There is also the lack of direct association between parameters/positioning on the cycle and injury due to limited studies examining cyclists with and without pain or injury and a lack of longitudinal studies. More research is needed to establish clear links and recommendations by manipulating parameters based on the available literature and knowledge of biomechanics impacting specific areas of the knee. Longer term effects on pain, performance, and participation should then be assessed. Another limitation is the inclusion of 2D measurements in some studies. 2D data capture can be misleading as movement outside of the sagittal plane impacts how each joint is visualized on a 2D image. In addition, 3D kinetic measurements are needed to fully understand the effects on the knee in all three planes.

Firstly, most cyclists consulting with a knee overuse injury complain of pain almost exclusively during cycling. There is no typical movie sign, or pain when walking stairs or during squatting as typically seen in patellofemoral pain syndrome. Secondly, the main treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome consists of quadriceps strengthening exercises and cycling (9,19) . However, the quadriceps is definitely one of the most developed muscles in high level cyclists.

Content: According to , a stiffer landing technique significantly increases the risk of developing overuse and acute lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. The problematic techniques identified include a heel-strike position, greater ankle inversion, greater knee dynamic abduction, reduced hip flexion angle, higher external hip rotation strength, and reduced hip abduction strength. Players with ACL injuries had hip flexion angles below 20 o at initial contact, which were significantly more common in females compared to males . In addition, injured athletes exhibited significantly lower hip abduction strength and higher external hip rotation strength compared to non-injured athletes, suggesting that reduced hip abduction strength is associated with a higher risk of ACL injury . According to knee biomechanics, reduced knee flexion angle ( 20 o ) at initial contact and greater knee moments are key risk factors for knee injuries, while a higher peak knee flexion angle decreases this risk . Increasing dynamic knee valgus angle is a critical factor in knee injury during landing. Players with knee injuries exhibited an 8.4 o greater knee valgus angle at initial contact and significant increases in peak knee abduction moment, significantly elevating the risk of knee injuries . Regarding ankle biomechanics, the injured player landed in a heel-strike position with a mean dorsiflexion of 2 o at initial contact and transitioned to a flat-foot position over the next 20 ms, increasing the plantarflexion angle by an average of 12 o . Moreover, ankle inversion during landing significantly increases the risk of lateral ankle injuries, which account for over 80% of such injuries . This inward rotation of the ankle can damage the lateral collateral ligaments, particularly the anterior tibiofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. Ankle sprains are more likely when the ankle is in greater inversion.

Content: compressive forces. The findings of the studies in this systematic review and earlier studies have implications for loading of the knee joint during cycling and suggest that lower cadences, lower workloads, a higher saddle height, and foot eversion might be preferred for cyclists with knee pain due to tibiofemoral compressive joint loading, such as with medial tibiofemoral OA. In contrast, cyclists with anterior cruciate ligament injury or reconstruction may benefit from a lower saddle height and lower cadences. 30,34,37 However, force effectiveness, a measure of force output in relation to angle of force application, may be decreased with these settings, 29 and thus the effects of combining these conditions is unknown. The effect of crank length due to loading is more difficult to interpret as a shorter crank length at a higher cadence increases power output, 25 yet increased crank lengths may shift more of the power production from the knee extensors to the hip extensors. 27 When comparing the moments around the knee to other activities such as walking, jogging, and stair climbing, the extension and flexion moments are generally smaller when cycling at 120 Watts. At 240 Watts, the loads were similar to the other activities. 38 Knee injuries are the most commonly reported injuries in cyclists, thus it may be the combined effects of workload, cadence, and positioning on the cycle that contribute to injury.

Content: Cycling has become a very popular sport recently, and it continues to gain popularity. It is a frequently employed method of recreation, rehabilitation, and even competition. Often in the course of rehabilitation or recreation, the goal is to strengthen one structure while minimizing stress on another. Using the information provided, it becomes easier to identify which anatomical structures are stressed and when they are active. There appears to be an intricate interaction of leg muscles during cycling, as the muscles show overlapping periods of activity. Cycling efficiency may even be influenced by some of the biomechanical factors discussed. The data presented on seat height, stating high seat heights cause a greater stress to the ACL and meniscotibial ligaments, pose a dilemma for the physical therapist treating a patient who has undergone ACL reconstruction and has some patellofemoral pain and/or crepitus. Keeping the seat high may help decrease patellofemoral pressures (although this has yet to be documented), while potentially increasing the stress on the ACL. Evidence indicates that increasing the seat height decreases the compressive forces at the tibiofemoral joint, although such stresses are small compared to the tibiofemoral stresses in level walking (2-4 times bodyweight), stairclimbing (4 times bodyweight), or rising from a chair (3-7 times bodyweight) (7).

Extreme hip abduction angles at kick initiation can be detrimental. For example, a study of 21 competitive swimmers reported that hip abduction angles of less than 37 or greater than 42 were associated with a higher knee injury rate. 46 Increased varus and valgus loads also occur in the knee in addition to rapid knee extension. Due to the kick style in the breaststroke technique, increased tension across the medial compartment and increased compression of the lateral compartment occur. 34 Clinical and arthroscopic examination of 9 breaststroke swimmers with medial knee pain found medial compartment synovitis in 7 swimmers. 21 Rovere and Nichols proposed that inflammation and fibrosis of the synovial plica cause medial knee pain; they found thickened and tender medial plica in 47% of breaststroke swimmers with medial knee pain. 37 There is increased strain of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) due to high valgus loads during the whip kick, which can present with tenderness of the femoral or tibial origin of the MCL. 19 Repetitive valgus loads may result in pes anserinus tendinitis or bursitis. 35 Strain injuries of the hip flexors and adductors (particularly adductor magnus and brevis) occur in breaststroke swimmers. 35

Content: Cycling is an increasingly popular recreational and competitive activity, and cycling-related injuries are becoming more common. Many common cycling injuries of the lower extremity are preventable. These include knee pain, patellar quadriceps tendinitis, iliotibial band syndrome, hip pain, medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, compartment syndrome, numbness of the foot, and metatarsalgia. Injury is caused by a combination of inadequate preparation, inappropriate equipment, poor technique, and overuse. Nonsurgical management may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, ice, a reduction in training intensity, orthotics, night splints, and physical therapy. Injury prevention should be the focus, with particular attention to bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, proper rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training. F rom November2001through October 2002, approximately 33 million US residents rode a bicycle an average of 6 days a month, for an average of &gt;1 hour on a typical day. 1 The number of bicycling trips taken between 1990 and 1995 doubled following implementation of the National Bicycle and Walking Study ; 2 this trend continues. The increased number of bicyclists has led to increased numbers of associated injuries. 2,3 Traumatic injury occurs as a result of overuse injury from repetitive motion and from unexpected motion. Overuse injury is caused by repetitive loading of bone, joint, and soft tissue with inadequate recovery time. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury potential. Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique. Lower limb injury can be sustained by both the elite cyclist and the casual cyclist.

The latter injuries are more consistent and predictable. Fitness, cycling technique, and lower limb anatomy often contribute to injury that results from repetitive motion and overuse. Injury is especially common in the cyclist with poor technique. Prevention of these injuries is centered around several basic principles, such as proper bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, correct rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training regimens.

Content: Common Approaches in Rehabilitation: A Review of Principles Injury rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of an athlete's recovery after injury, especially in intense sports such as badminton. The approach involves a series of steps designed to ensure effective and efficient recovery, reduce the risk of re-injury, and allow players to return to their peak performance. The basic principles of injury rehabilitation include rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE), followed by physical therapy and strengthening exercises aimed at restoring function, strength and mobility of the injured area ( Sara Horvat , 2024). Rest is the initial and perhaps most important step in the rehabilitation process. It not only refers to the cessation of the activity that caused the injury but also includes activity modification to avoid stressing the injured area. The application of ice immediately after the injury occurs can help reduce inflammation and pain, while compression and elevation contribute to the reduction of swelling (Kwiecien, 2023). After the initial phase of recovery, physical therapy plays an important role in injury rehabilitation. It involves a series of exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility and stability without overloading the injured area. The physical therapy approach should be individualised, considering the type of injury and the specific needs of the player (Carreno et al., 2021). Strengthening exercises are another important component of injury rehabilitation. It not only focuses on the injured area but also on strengthening the surrounding muscles and support structures to prevent re-injury. Research has shown that a structured exercise programme can significantly reduce the risk of re-injury and improve athletic performance (Dijksma et al., 2020).

For instance, the association with other sports activities, 3 bicycle misalignment, 4 inexperience or lack of pre-ride conditioning, 8 and long distances ride 10 were among the suggested triggers for knee pain. Dettori and Norvel, 11 discussed some possible mechanisms for non-traumatic injuries and prevention plan. As an example, for patellofemoral inflammation, the saddle could be too low and/or too far forward and most authors have encouraged to follow preventive adjustments, like proper saddle adjustment, the use of orthotics, cleat adjustment, and reduction in gear ratio (especially early in the season), among others. 1,2,12,13 However, only a few of these strategies have been tested experimentally, and most of the advocated recommendations lack of solid evidence that could be important in preventing injuries. Sabeti-Aschraf et al 14 investigated 169 competitive mountain bikers and correlated their injury occurrence with the configuration of their bicycles. They found that 87 had overuse injuries after a race (Babenberger Trophy) and observed a significant correlation between inadequate saddle-pedal distance and knee pain ( p &lt; 0.04). They concluded that bicycle adjustments have a direct impact on the incidence of overuse injuries in the competitive mountain bike cyclist. Conversely, Dahlquist et al 7 declared in their study that flexibility, strength, and bike fit measures did not predict injury and concluded that injury risk and prevention strategies need additional studies. There are a minimum of 20 review articles published suggesting how to prevent and treat knee pain and injuries despite lack evidence supporting the current advocated practices. With this in mind, the determinants of overuse injuries and pain in cyclists that are supported by evidence remain unclear.

Guyon canal syndrome and handlebar palsy are usually self-limiting conditions. Methods of GCS management include using antiinflammatory medications or painkillers, such as NSAIDs, immobilization of the wrist and hand, or steroid injections, preferably under USG control . In most cases, conservative methods are not sufficient to relieve the patient's symptoms . The ultimate treatment method is surgery, the main aim of chich is to relieve the compressed nerve [6, 7]. Surgery is implemented mostly when conservative methods are not effective, or the reason is organic . Among potential postsurgery complications, one can list : - nerve injury during burgery; - infection; - scar or keloid formation; - vascular problems, such as thrombophlebitis. Post-operative complications are relatively rare, but it is necessary to take them into consideration at all times . Apart from the management techniques listed above, handlebar palsy is almost fully curable when a rider takes a few months break from cycling . Prevention methods include : - wearing padded cycling gloves; - frequent changes of hand position; - using handlebars that allow resting the upper limbs on forearms instead of wrists. The treatment should include adjusting the sitting position on the bike, as well as modifying the hand grip (bikefitting) This simple modifications may lead to fast and nearly complete recovery. This adjustmets also protect the cyclist form the further damage caused by repetitive pressure and vibrations ocurring when cycling .

Content: While cycling is an excellent way of keeping fit and healthy , it can lead to various injuries from an acute incident or chronic exposure to riding. Common areas where symptoms develop include the back, knees, and shoulders, particularly if the bicycle has not been correctly adjusted to the rider . Cycling may also cause nerve injuries, leading to impotence in male riders . However, the hands are more commonly affected, with injury to the median and ulnar nerves (M&amp;UN), resulting in sensory alterations such as numbness (paresthesia), pain, and muscle atrophy. Dubbed 'cyclist's palsy' , this condition can occur acutely, following a single prolonged episode of cycling or after repeated exposure with excessive pressure on the handlebars from a wrong frame size, poor positioning, or overall conditioning of the rider . Often dismissed by cyclists as 'part of the ride,' the increasing popularity of this activity will likely mean that cyclist's palsy will be a more frequent pathology in the future. It is important that rehabilitation specialists, sports physicians, and hand surgeons who encounter riders with these symptoms be aware of the problem and treat it accordingly. This review aims to summarize existing clinical knowledge of cyclist's palsy, including investigations that confirm the changes and appropriate treatments to limit the functional impact on the individual.

Nonsurgical management may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, ice, a reduction in training intensity, orthotics, night splints, and physical therapy. Injury prevention should be the focus, with particular attention to bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, proper rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training. F rom November2001through October 2002, approximately 33 million US residents rode a bicycle an average of 6 days a month, for an average of &gt;1 hour on a typical day. 1 The number of bicycling trips taken between 1990 and 1995 doubled following implementation of the National Bicycle and Walking Study ; 2 this trend continues. The increased number of bicyclists has led to increased numbers of associated injuries. 2,3 Traumatic injury occurs as a result of overuse injury from repetitive motion and from unexpected motion. Overuse injury is caused by repetitive loading of bone, joint, and soft tissue with inadequate recovery time. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury potential. Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique. Lower limb injury can be sustained by both the elite cyclist and the casual cyclist.

Content: Although systems-level infrastructure and built environments are the primary determinants of cycling safety, injury prevention programs and family counselling also have roles. Approximately one-half of children who are admitted to hospital with a cyclingrelated injury have sustained a severe head injury, and head injuries also represent between 45% and 100% of injuries causing death ( 43 ). The literature is unequivocal that helmet use reduces both the number and severity of head injuries significantly ( 44 ). Two Cochrane systematic reviews demonstrated that helmets reduce the risk of head and brain injuries by 69%, severe brain injuries by 74%, and facial injuries by 65% across all age groups ( 45 , 46 ). A 2018 metaanalysis confirmed these findings, noting a 48% reduction in total head injuries, a 60% reduction in serious head injuries, a 23% reduction in facial injuries, and a reduction in the total number of killed or seriously injured cyclists by 34% ( 47 ). The challenges of increasing helmet use in the paediatric population persist, however. The literature has shown that helmet legislation is not only the most powerful lever that policy-makers have to protect young people ( 48 ), but these laws do not discourage or decrease the number of children cycling in jurisdictions where they are passed ( 49 ). Consistently however, the rates of bicycle ridership and helmet use among young people in Canada have been associated most strongly with higher SES ( 50 , 51 ). There is also an urban versus rural divide, whereby children in rural environments use helmets less than their urban peers ( 51 , 52 ). Other safety equipment (e.g., wrist guards) have fewer clear benefits. One 2005 study found that wrist guards impeded children's ability to cycle comfortably and may have limited utility for protecting against injuries sustained during a fall ( 53 ).

Content: Most hamstring injuries respond well to conservative management. The main priority of the non-surgical treatment is to control the pain and decrease inflammation caused by the acute injury. There is, however, no full consensus on what the conservative treatment should consist in.[22, 25] The most agreed on and valid treatment is RICE - rest, ice, compression, elevation. It restrains the initial inflammatory response and helps control edema and haemorrhage. Despite that, recent studies have exposed its limitation. One of the main concerns is that a long resting phase longer than 72 hours can lead to a bigger loss of muscle strength and flexibility and can delay the return to normal function. It is thought that an earlier and gradual return to activity is related to a rapid recovery. Consequently, the POLICE protocol - protection, optimal load, ice, compression, elevation - has shown better results. Optimal load means gradually replacing rest with a balanced and incremental amount of physical activity. This also contributes towards better regeneration and orientation of the injured muscle fibres.[27, 28] Protection provided by crutches, braces or other supports is also highly recommended to avoid further injury to the affected site. It is necessary to point out that the non-surgical approach to treating hamstring injuries is dependent on its severity - for example, more extensive injuries to the muscle and soft tissue may experience a longer period of recovery.[8, 24] Considering this high discrepancy, there isn't a fixed time protocol that can be applied, but rather a recovery program tailored to the patient's symptoms and level of pain, to ensure an adequate rehabilitation, focusing on strengthening and regain of function. Returning to activity prematurely may submit patients to a high risk of reinjury.[22, 29]

Many studies focused on knee pain in cyclists often state that patellofemoral pain syndrome is the underlying cause, without any proof of evidence (1,16) . In our experience treating high-level cyclists, the above-mentioned knee conditions are only rarely seen in these athletes. In this study we report the results of 53 cyclists' knees, outlining a comprehensive differential diagnosis of typical overuse injuries. This study describes the clinical features, physical examination and diagnostic imaging modalities of the most frequent clinical entities in our practice.

Content: Cycling is an activity that tends to be prescribed often in the presence of injury due to its low impact nature. A typical cyclist however, will perform something in the order of 5000-6000 pedal strokes per hour and as a result, overuse injuries in cycling are very common. In a survey of elite cyclists, the most common injury experienced was low back pain with over 40% reporting suffering from back pain but losing only 2-3 days per year as a result. The next most common complaint was knee pain with 32% of riders experiencing knee pain, however riders tended to lose much more time, typically 10-12 days of training as a result of their knee injury. Due to the high volume of repetition, cycling provides plenty of scope for magnifying minor biomechanical issues, resulting in overuse injuries, particularly at the knee. These biomechanical issues may result from either poor strength, technique or bike set up. <!-- image --> Cycling incorporates all of the major leg muscles at different phases of the pedal stroke. The optimal bike set up is one in which all of these muscles are in their ideal length to generate power at the point of the pedal stroke when they are the most active. An optimal position on the bike should allow for the most efficient balance of forces on the body in order to prevent injury not only in the knee, but in other areas such as the hips and back. Cycling predominantly involves use of the hips, knee and ankle joints. While the hip and ankle joint are designed to work in a range of positions, the knee functions essentially as a hinged joint, designed only for repetitive loading in the one plane.

Content: Cycling remains a popular activity for children and youth around the world, combining the fun of moving at speed with numerous health and societal benefits. However, cycling is also associated with risk for serious injury and death. Over the past decade, research has increasingly shown that improving safety for cyclists depends, in large part, on the environment they are cycling in as well as on individual safety measures such as helmet use. The pandemic provided greater opportunity for many children and youth to engage in cycling, and refocused public attention on safer cycling infrastructure such as protected bike lanes. This statement reviews the evidence supporting safer cycling infrastructure for children and youth along with the physical and mental health benefits of cycling. The advantages of active transportation for young people, and how the built environment influences their cycling safety and uptake, are discussed. An overview of measures individuals can take to improve cycling safety is followed by recommendations for clinicians, the cycling community, parents, and policymakers.

Content: articles not related to the aim of this study. The removal of articles from the assessment of titles and abstracts encompassed the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. Fortyone articles were then assessed and separated in 3 main categories. Twenty review articles were not assessed but will be referred in the 'Discussion' section (i.e., review articles). Ten studies with focus on the epidemiology of overuse injuries were also separated to be discussed in terms of the incidence of injuries in cycling. Eleven articles were deemed eligible for full text appraisal but 1 was not assessed due to difficulties in retrieving the full text and the original language being German 16 (Figure 1). Results are presented in tables with information on sample size, study design, methods, outcomes, and main findings for each study. Studies involved generally the assessment of biomechanical outcomes associated with knee pain in cyclists. Four studies 17-20 involved the assessment of cyclists (mostly recreational) reporting knee pain related to bicycle pedaling or providing medical evidence for knee pain (e.g., MRI). Two articles involved case studies of individual cyclists who had cycling-related knee pain. 21,22 One study 21 did not assess bicycle pedaling and was limited to clinical description of symptoms and imaging scan. Four studies 23-26 did not assess cyclists with injury or pain on the knees but assessed injuryrelated outcomes that could potentially explain the reason for why cyclists develop knee pain (Table 2). Among the outcomes, authors reported kinematics (e.g., knee flexion angle), kinetics (e.g., knee joint moments), muscular activation (e.g., surface electromyography), and perceived comfort gathered from stationary cycling trials and others acquired from various tasks (e.g., isokinetic dynamometry).

Content: Head injuries, and specifically traumatic brain injury (TBI) are among the most typical injuries among fatally injured cyclists (Joseph et al., 2017; Ekstrom and Linder, 2017). In-depth analysis of 71 fatal bicycle crashes in Norway in 2005-2012 in which a cyclist was killed, showed that 54% of unhelmeted cyclists (65% of cyclists had been unhelmeted) most likely would have survived the crash if they had worn a helmet (Statens vegvesen, 2014). The effects of bicycle helmets on head injury have previously been investigated in several metaanalyses (in chronological order): Thompson et al. (1999), Attewell et al. (2001); Elvik, 2011, Elvik, 2013; Olivier and Creighton (2016). The two oldest meta-analyses found large reductions of head and brain injury among helmeted cyclists (about 60% or more). Elvik (2013) concluded that the results by Attewell et al. (2001) are affected by publication. In a re-analysis of the studies included in the meta-analysis by Attewell et al. (2001), Elvik (2013) found somewhat smaller effects of bicycle helmets when more recent studies were included in meta-analysis (-50% head injuries) than when only older studies were included (-57% head injuries). The meta-analysis by Olivier and Creighton (2016) is the most comprehensive one. It is based on 40 studies from 1989 to 2016 and concludes that bicycle helmets reduce head injury by 51%, serious head injury by 69% and fatal head injury by 65%. With the help of meta-regression analysis, Olivier and Creighton (2016) show that the effects of bicycle helmets differ by type of injury, but that none of the following factors are likely to have affected the results: Setting for data collection, pro- vs. retrospective data collection, mandatory helmet legislation (yes vs. no), age category (adults vs. children), proportion of males, proportion of bicycle-motor vehicle collisions, time trend bias (publication year), and publication bias either.

Content: Implementation of a Structured Warm-up and Cool-down Programme: A thorough warm-up before training or competition and an adequate cool-down process afterwards can reduce the risk of injury. The programme should include specific exercises that increase blood flow to the muscles and improve flexibility, especially in areas most commonly affected by injury. Body Awareness and Balance Training: Improving body awareness and balance through proprioceptive exercises can strengthen players' ability to control their movements and reduce the risk of falling or moving unnaturally, which can lead to injury. Use of Evidence-Based Rehabilitation Techniques: Healthcare professionals should adopt rehabilitation techniques that are supported by current scientific evidence. This includes manual therapy, strengthening and flexibility exercises, and the use of rehabilitation technologies such as biofeedback and laser therapy. Player Education: Educating players on the importance of following rehabilitation protocols, early recognition of injury symptoms, and injury prevention strategies is key to ensuring quick and effective recovery and preventing re-injury. Personalising Rehabilitation Protocols: Recognising that every athlete and injury is unique, it is crucial to tailor the rehabilitation programme to each individual's specific needs, including considering the type of injury, severity, and sporting goals of the player. Multidisciplinary Team Collaboration: Close cooperation between coaches, physiotherapists, sports psychologists and other healthcare professionals can speed up the recovery process and ensure a holistic approach to injury rehabilitation. Adopting this approach in daily practice will help maximise player well-being and minimise downtime due to injury, allowing them to return to the field faster and in the best condition possible.

Our results show that friction related overuse injuries are a frequent and probably underrated cause of knee pain in high level cyclists. Patellofemoral pain syndrome, though often suggested as a primary diagnosis in the literature, seems to be unusual in high level cycling. Thorough history, clinical examination and additional imaging techniques provide the ultimate key to a prompt and correct diagnosis. Successful treatment of the specific type of overuse injury will increase the recovery rate and ensure rapid return to pain-free cycling activities.

The onus of cycling-related injury prevention has shifted somewhat from the individuals engaged in this activity toward the built environment. Local governments must be informed of options that build, expand, and promote safer cycling infrastructure. They must also invest in redevelopment. With families they see, health care professionals should promote active transportation for children and youth to and from school and advocate for policies that support safer cycling and walking in their communities. The Canadian Paediatric Society supports safe, active, and equitable cycling for children and youth through enhancing and optimizing the built environment as follows: - Install more protected (and ideally, elevated) bike lanes that physically separate cyclists from motorized traffic, and make existing pilot lanes permanent. Focus should be on and around areas of high use by children and youth, especially near schools, community centres, and recreation and play spaces. - Deploy more speed and red-light cameras in high-traffic areas near schools, busy neighbourhoods, and recreation and play spaces. - Implement traffic calming measures where children and youth live, play, and travel to and from school. - Adopt 'Vision Zero' interventions that increase road safety for all users. - Increase helmet use among children and youth through education, legislation, and training programs (with evaluation and follow-up). Mandatory helmet legislation should exist across all provinces and territories and, ideally, for all ages. - Target research and advocacy to increase cycling, road safety, and helmet use in rural and remote areas of Canada.

Most injuries are managed conservatively with good and excellent results. Currently, PRP shows the most promising results in aiding non-operative treatment. Complete injury of all three hamstrings and proximal avulsions with 2 cm of retraction have the strongest surgical indication. The main goals of the rehabilitation protocol are to return the athlete to activity at a pre-injury level of performance and to minimize risk of reinjury, focusing on eccentric and proprioceptive exercises. Each individual should have an injury tailored rehabilitation plan. Further studies will help to define and optimize a protocol for the treatment and rehabilitation of these lesions.

Content: Several authors have discussed possibilities for prevention of a soccer injury such as: - warm-up with more emphasis on stretching; - regular cool-down; - adequate rehabilitation with sufficient recovery time; - proprioceptive training; - protective equipment; - good playing field conditions; - adherence to the existing rules. These topics are closely related to the 10-point action plan to avoid sports injury proposed by the Sport Smart programme of the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation (table II). Preventive programmes generally focus either on the reduction of all injuries associated with a given sport or on a particular type of injury that is extremely severe or frequent. With respect to soccer, three studies have focused on the prevention of injuries in general and seven others have evaluated the prevention of specific types of injury, namely ankle sprains, severe injuries of the knee and hamstring strains (table III).

Content: The development of Runner's Knee can be attributed to a range of factors: - Overuse and Repetitive Stress : Activities that involve a lot of knee bending - like jogging, squatting, and biking - can lead to overuse injuries in the knee. Repetitive stress on the knee joint can irritate the nerves of the patella and strain the tendons. - Muscle Imbalance and Weakness : Weak quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip muscles can contribute to Runner's Knee. These imbalances can cause the patella to track improperly along the femoral groove, leading to increased stress and pain. - Biomechanical Issues : Problems with foot alignment, including flat feet or overpronation, can affect the way forces are transmitted through the leg, impacting the knee joint. - Direct Trauma to the Knee : A direct hit to the knee can lead to Runner's Knee, as it can disturb the alignment or the balance of forces on the patella. Understanding these causes is crucial for both prevention and treatment. It's important to note that Runner's Knee is typically more common in females than males, possibly due to differences in muscle strength and pelvic width. As physiotherapy professionals, our expertise in diagnosing and managing conditions like Runner's Knee is backed by years of experience and ongoing education. We understand the intricacies of knee pain and are committed to providing our patients with the most effective, evidencebased treatment strategies.

Content: The primary symptom of Runner's Knee is a dull, aching pain around or behind the kneecap (patella). This pain is often triggered by activities that put pressure on the knee joint, such as running, squatting, climbing stairs, or even sitting with the knee bent for an extended period. Other symptoms may include a grinding or popping sensation in the knee and a feeling of instability or weakness in the knee joint. Diagnosing Runner's Knee involves a thorough physical examination by a healthcare professional, preferably a physiotherapist or orthopaedic specialist. They may perform specific tests to assess knee pain and function. In some cases, imaging tests like X-rays or MRI scans are used to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as a meniscal tear or ligament injury.

Content: - Runner's knee : Patellofemoral pain syndrome, commonly known as runner's knee, causes pain just behind or next to the kneecap. Discomfort often begins as mild pain that can worsen over time, especially when you put pressure on your knee. - Iliotibial band syndrome: The iliotibial band, or IT band, is a long piece of tissue that connects your outer hip to your knee. IT band syndrome happens when the IT band repetitively rubs against the leg bone, causing sharp pain on the outer part of your leg just above the knee. - Shin splints: Also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, shin splints cause pain along the shinbones in your lower legs. This injury frequently occurs when you increase your running volume too quickly. - Plantar fasciitis : The bottom of your foot contains a thick layer of tissue called fascia, which acts as a spring when you walk or run. Over time, intense running can lead to pain in your heel and the middle of your foot that can worsen after prolonged activity. - Stress fractures: Repetitive stress can cause hairline cracks to form in bones. Runners often get stress fractures in the heel, lower leg or top of the foot. - Achilles tendinitis: When your Achilles tendon, which connects your calf muscle to your heel, becomes inflamed, it can cause pain and swelling in your lower leg. - Ankle sprains: A sprain can result when you overstretch the muscle between your ankle and leg, which often happens by landing on the outside of your foot.

If aligned properly, the patella moves painlessly during a run. Poor patella alignment this is known as a patellar tracking problem. This improper alignment causes uneven wear which causes pain and inflammation.

There are several ways you can gradually rehabilitate your knee over time to remove the current pain and prevent future pain. see active.com article for more info - Make sure your shoes offer proper support for your feet. - Properly stretch your legs before running. - Make sure you use proper form when running. - Make sure there isn't an imbalance in your leg muscles by equally training them all (running does a lot for the hamstring, but not a lot for the quads). - Reduce your mileage to prevent "overuse." Runner's Knee can come as a result of increasing your mileage too quickly; try going back to your 1-2 minute run 1-2 minute walk because your body might not be ready for much more than that (yet). - Ice your knee and take anti-inflammatory drugs (ex. ibuprofen) whenever you exerpience knee pain. With regard to the shin pain, this is almost certainly shin splints ( ). The shin splints most likely came about because you increased your mileage too quickly, and as a result your muscles weren't strong enough to absorb the stress from running while fatigued. The same remedies for Runners Knee apply here, so make sure you stretch, workout the whole leg, have proper footware, and so on. see wikipedia article <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 3 <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 2 <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 1

I took a couple of weeks off of running to let my body adjust to the increased bicycling and then started up again. Now, I've started having such bad knee pain that I can't run more than a mile. It only hurts when I run, and starts about 5-10 minutes into the run - it is a painful stiffness on the outside of my right knee. When I stop running or do other exercise, the pain goes away. I talked to my brother (who at one point studied to become a PT) and he said it sounds like runner's knee. So I got a foam roller and started rolling out my IT band 2-3 times a day, and it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference. So here's my question: it seems like this is related to my new bicycling routine, since that's the only lifestyle change I've made. I am eager to hear if anyone else has dealt with a situation like this and how they were able to start running again. I do wonder if it could be related to my bicycle technique, or just in general the fact that my ride is so hilly and traffic-y. Or anything else that I haven't thought of. People who don't bicycle just don't get this one - so I'd really love to know if anyone has some thoughts on this.

I got the knee pain so bad that I couldn't bend my right knee to walk up stairs, or atleast not without wincing. The doctor gave me anti-inflammatory medicine, and it cleared it right up. I think you should try taking some over the counter stuff yourself to see if that helps the knee pain. If it does, I would suggest (although I am not a doctor, this is just a theory of mine) taking a dose of over the counter anti-inflammatory medice before you run. I think the knee pain most probably comes from either or both of the following two things. The first is bad form and the second is bad shoes. Typical running shoes promote landing on the heel, while naturally, you should be landing on the balls of your feet. Landing on the heel creates more stress on your knee. Thus when you run, try to be concious about how you are landing to decrease the impact on your knees.

Content: Alongside physiotherapy, incorporating other effective strategies can be crucial in the management of Runner's Knee. It's about fostering strength and resilience within the body rather than relying on external supports. - Activity Modification : Adjusting your activity levels can be necessary to allow your knee to heal. This might involve reducing the distance or intensity of runs or taking a short break from high-impact activities. Such modifications help in managing symptoms while gradually restoring the knee's function. - Strengthening from Within : At Gemini Health Group, we advocate for strengthening the body's natural support systems. This includes focusing on exercises that build strength and stability in the muscles around the knee and hip, as well as improving overall core strength. Our approach is rooted in the belief that building a stronger body is more effective and sustainable than relying on external devices like orthotics. This philosophy guides our treatment plans and is a core part of our practice as physiotherapists. - Education and Self-Management : Educating patients about the mechanics of their body and how to manage conditions like Runner's Knee is fundamental. We encourage a deeper understanding of body mechanics and self-care practices that enhance resilience to pain and injuries. This education includes proper training techniques, understanding the importance of balance between activity and rest, and learning how to recognize and respond to body signals.

Content: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is knee pain under or around your kneecap (patella). Healthcare providers also sometimes call PFPS runner's knee. Your patella is the bone at the front of your knee joint. It helps your quadriceps muscle move your leg, protects your knee, and supports lots of important muscles, tendons and ligaments. 'Patellofemoral' is the medical term for the connection between your patella and your thigh bone (femur). Usually, your patella fits into a groove in your femur and slides smoothly along that space when you move your knee. If you have PFPS, something may affect how your patella moves and make it painful. People usually develop PFPS over time. It can affect one or both of your knees at once. Visit a healthcare provider if you're experiencing knee pain that doesn't get better in a few weeks.

Excessive pressure across the patellofemoral joint is caused by hill climbing, riding in high gears, and a too-slow cadence. 3 The increased pressure results in excessive shear and compression of articular cartilage, leading to chondromalacia. Patellofemoral malalignment also may cause patellofemoral syndrome as a result of the uneven distribution of pressures across the joint surface (Figure 5). Risk factors for malalignment include high or lateral position of the patella; dysplasia of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) muscle; a large quadriceps angle; inflexibility of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles; and limb deformities, including femoral anteversion, external tibial torsion, and hyperpronated feet with hindfoot valgus. 13,14 Improper bicycle fit also can lead Normal (A) and abnormal (B) patellofemoral alignment. <!-- image --> to patellofemoral syndrome. When the bicycle seat is positioned too low or too far forward, excessive pressure is experienced across the patellofemoral joint. These positions result in excessive flexion of the knee, leading to a more perpendicular vector force across the joint. 10 In addition to proper seat position, adequate training can help minimize the incidence of patellofemoral syndrome. Quadriceps strengthening focused on the VMO, along with stretching of the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemiussoleus complex, may help improve patellofemoral alignment. Another method of strengthening is electrical muscle stimulation, which helps establish the desired 1:1 ratio between the VMOandthevastuslateralis (VL) muscles during quadriceps contraction.

Content: Several knee structures are potentially at risk for overuse injury with cycling due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most common causes of knee pain in cyclists, resulting in anterior knee pain. 5 Female gender is a risk factor for PFP, 10 and PFP is more common in female cyclists. 11 An additional risk factor is reduced quadriceps strength, 10 which may cause the greatest prevalence of PFP during preseason training in cyclists. 4 Additional associated factors with PFP in cyclists include excessive varus knee moments during the power stroke, 12 excessive valgus knee alignment, 5 repetitive loading of the patella, 13 weak gluteal muscles, 5 increased Q angles, 11 excessive patellar lateral tilt, 5 and excessive foot pronation. 5 Patellar and quadriceps tendinopathies are additional causes of anterior knee pain in cyclists, 5 which are caused by chronic repetitive overload of tendons during quadriceps contractions. 14,15 Iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome is the most common cause of lateral knee pain in cyclists. 2 Proposed mechanisms for ITB syndrome are compression of fat beneath the ITB at the lateral femoral epicondyle or friction of the ITB as it moves across the lateral femoral epicondyle during repetitive knee flexion and extension. 2,11,16 When the knee reaches 20-30 of flexion, the ITB passes over the lateral femoral epicondyle, 17,18 creating an impingement zone for fat and an adventitial bursa. 2,5,11 ITB syndrome is likely caused by increased tibial internal rotation, ITB tightness, inward pointing of toes on the pedals, increased hip adduction, a bicycle saddle position that is too high, and rapid increase in mileage. 1,2,5,16,19 Medial knee injuries seen in cyclists include medial collateral ligament bursitis, plica syndrome, pes anserine syndrome and medial meniscus tear

Content: This systematic review of the literature intended to assess the potential factors associated with overuse knee injuries and knee pain in cyclists. After a careful search on the main databases related to health and sports sciences, we observed that there is limited evidence on the potential mechanisms related to overuse-related pain or injury. Surprisingly, 20 narrative reviews covering, but not limited to, knee pain in cycling were found, even though the evidence is scarce in terms of the determinants of overuse knee injuries, which limits the options for prevention and treatment. Some differences were observed when comparing cyclists with and without knee pain. Cyclists with knee pain presented a medial projection of the lower limb during the power phase of cycling (from 12 to 6 o'clock positions of the crank) associated with an increased ankle dorsiflexion. 17 Although a larger medial projection of the femur in relation to the patella could lead to a reduced contact area for the patellofemoral joint, 27 this may be an adaptation to injury due to the retrospective nature of findings from Bailey et al. 17 The delayed offset of vastus lateralis and earlier offset of vastus medialis observed by Dieter et al 19 in cyclists with knee pain could also be a consequence from the medial projection of the femur. However, no data have been found in this issue when uninjured cyclists enforced a medial projection of their knees. In addition, no evidence on the control from hip adductors and/or abductors has been shown, which could help determining the rationale for the medial projection of the femur. In runners, a delayed onset of hip abductors has been associated with knee pain, 28 which provides a potential link between a delayed activation of hip abductors and the medial knee projection.

Abnormal kicking mechanics are often present in swimmers with knee pain. Underwater videos of breaststroke swimmers showed that symptomatic swimmers complaining of MCL tenderness had different whip kick patterns. 44 Swimmers with medial patellar facet pain keep their hips in more abduction and demonstrate greater hip and knee flexion, which cause medial facet contact on the intercondylar ridge. In contrast, those with MCL pain derotated and plantar flexed the ankles as the knees extended.

Content: Running Injuries comprises seven chapters: In Chapter 1, 'New insights into running injuries,' a distinction is made between extrinsic an intrinsic sports injuries. Extrinsic sports injuries result from the application of a single, irresistible force to the body, which causes the immediate onset of pain and disability. They occur especially in contact or collision-type sports. Intrinsic injuries do not originate from forces outside the body and their onset is typically gradual. These injuries are very often found in long-distance runners. The unique feature of running injuries is that they have an identifiable and treatable cause. The authors emphasise that until that cause is rectified, the conventional approach - rest, drugs, injections, and surgery - is an expensive waste of time. The first one to conclude this in the 1970s was marathonrunning cardiologist George Sheehan. He found out that treatment of running injury must take into account every possible contributory factor - the genetics, unique physiology and biomechanics of the individual, the environment (specifically the running surface), the type of shoe that is worn, and the training. This implies that a holistic view must be adopted and any or all of these factors must be corrected if an injury is to be prevented or cured. Against this background, the authors' aim is to provide runners with 1) an understanding of how their own genetic predispositions make them vulnerable to injury, 2) the means to remain injury-free, and 3) the hope of returning to their sport in the shortest possible time.

Pes anserine bursitis results from repeated friction of the hamstring insertion over the bursa, leading to inflammation and the insidious onset of pain. The patient typically has significant tenderness to palpation over the pes anserine bursa, located 2 to 3 cm below the medial joint line (Figure 6). Hamstring stretching may help to relieve the pressure across the pes anserine bursa. Physical therapy may help in resolving muscle imbalance, and the patient may benefit from application of low-pulse laser and ultrasound. NSAIDs, along with a local corticosteroid injection, are another beneficial adjunct.

Content: Mary Beth Skylis (https://www.rei.com/blog/bio/mary-beth-skylis) | January 10, 2025 After 15 years of running, injury finally slowed me down. Moving forward meant changing my mindset. Before beginning any training plan, check in with your doctor or certified training professional to talk about what is right for you. I noticed a burning sensation in my feet for the first time during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, it was a faint flare, only becoming apparent after a lengthy run. Then it started to nag me, becoming a hard-to-ignore ache even on moderate training days. Before I knew it, I was struggling to run a single treadmill mile at the gym. I couldn ' t ignore the pain anymore. A trip to a specialist and an MRI revealed a plantar plate tear in my right foot. I went under the blade to repair it two months later, but surgery was just the beginning. After leaving the hospital with a hopeful mindset, I embarked on a six-month recovery as challenging to my usually tireless mind as it was to my 30-year-old body. After my right foot healed, persistent pain in the left one eventually led my podiatrist, Colorado-based Dr. Jared Menchin (https://www.leapfootandanklespecialists.com/), to diagnose me with osteoarthritis. Dr. Menchin told me, ' Lower extremity injuries are common in long-distance runners and endurance athletes, ' and the majority of those injuries were due to repetitive strain. So, I wasn ' t alone in my experience, but I took little comfort in my body ' s limitations. There was a high chance that I ' d worsen my condition if I continued running at my current pace. Something had to change.

Like most swimming pathology, overuse is the primary factor in causing Breaststroke swimmers have a fivefold higher risk of knee pain (relative risk, 5.1), although most occurs in the medial compartment, whereas freestyle has a reduced relative risk (0.5) for knee pain. 23 The biomechanics of the breaststroke generates high valgus loads due to the adducted hip position. Extreme hip abduction angles at kick initiation can be detrimental. For example, a study of 21 competitive swimmers reported that hip abduction angles of less than 37 or greater than 42 were associated with a higher knee injury rate. 46 Increased varus and valgus loads also occur in the knee in addition to rapid knee extension. Due to the kick style in the breaststroke technique, increased tension across the medial compartment and increased compression of the lateral compartment occur. 34 Clinical and arthroscopic examination of 9 breaststroke swimmers with medial knee pain found medial compartment synovitis in 7 swimmers. 21 Rovere and Nichols proposed that inflammation and fibrosis of the synovial plica cause medial knee pain; they found thickened and tender medial plica in 47% of breaststroke swimmers with medial knee pain. 37 There is increased strain of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) due to high valgus loads during the whip kick, which can present with tenderness of the femoral or tibial origin of the MCL. 19 Repetitive valgus loads may result in pes anserinus tendinitis or bursitis. 35 Strain injuries of the hip flexors and adductors (particularly adductor magnus and brevis) occur in breaststroke swimmers. 35

Content: Ok so now you have your bike set up just right, so problems solved? Not quite, the correct loading and tracking of the knee on the bike also relies on strength and technique. A common issue resulting in overload to the knee is excessive plantar flexion of the ankle through the pedal stroke. The ankle should remain in a relatively neutral position throughout the stroke, plantar flexion is the toe down position of the foot and ankle. Excessive plantarflexion has the effect of increasing the crank length or decreasing the saddle height at the top of the stroke and decreasing crank length or increasing saddle height at the bottom of the stroke. Another common issue is allowing the knee to drift in or out through the pedal stroke. As previously stated, the knee is basically a hinge joint deigned to operate in a forward plane with repetitive movements. Any repeated rotation in the knee as a result of either medial or lateral drift of the knee, will result in excessive force on both the meniscus (cartilage inside the knee) as well as on the tissue around the patella. Commonly this medial or lateral drift is related to poor strength and control of the deeper muscles of the hip joint.

Content: Running shoes serve as the principal interface connecting the foot and ground and have thus been posited as a pivotal mechanism that may influence the biomechanical factors associated with the aetiology of chronic injuries . Modern footwear (henceforth termed conventional footwear) typically feature a high degree of midsole cushioning, particularly in the rear portion of the shoe, stability and motion control technology designed to reduce rearfoot eversion and arch support systems. In addition to conventional footwear models, footwear manufacturers have introduced running shoes with varying levels of midsole cushioning, presenting both minimal and maximal running shoe options . Minimal running shoes are characterized by a low or zero heel-toe drop, enhanced midsole flexibility and reduced mass . On the other hand, maximal running shoes, despite featuring a low heel-toe drop, incorporate a significantly greater amount of midsole cushioning, spanning the entire length of the shoe . Tibial accelerations and the loading rate of the vertical ground reaction force are frequently utilized as proxy indicators for tibial loading and have long been proposed as potential contributors to the development of tibial stress fractures . Substantial research interest has been directed towards examining the impact of minimal and maximal running shoes on tibial accelerations and vertical loading rates during running. It has been observed that minimal running shoes are linked to heightened vertical loading rates and tibial accelerations in comparison to both traditional and maximal running shoes . However, no significant disparities in vertical loading rates and tibial accelerations have been identified between maximal and conventional running shoes .

Content: Importantly, this investigation showed that tibial stress fracture probability was significantly greater in the minimal compared to maximal footwear. Taking into account the parameters included in the probabilistic model, such increases were mediated firstly as a function of the significantly greater tibial strains allied with the increased number of daily loading cycles required to complete the required modelled daily distance. This investigation therefore indicates that minimal footwear places runners at a significantly increased risk from tibial stress fractures in comparison with maximal running shoes. Taking into account the high incidence of tibial stress fractures in runners , their debilitating and painful presentation, as well their high rate of re-occurrence , the findings from this study indicate that compared to minimal footwear, maximal running shoes appear to be effective in attenuating runners' likelihood of developing a tibial stress fracture.

Content: In conclusion, no comparison of conventional, minimal and maximal footwear has previously been undertaken using cumulative finite element and probabilistic analyses of tibial stress fractures. Therefore, this study adds to the present clinical and scientific knowledge base in footwear biomechanics by examining the effects of conventional, minimal and maximal footwear on tibial stress fracture probability in in runners. In the minimal and conventional conditions, tibial strains and strained volumes were increased statistically compared to maximal footwear. Furthermore, in minimal footwear, tibial stress fracture probability was significantly increased compared to the maximal footwear. The current investigation importantly shows that compared to minimal footwear, maximal running shoes appear to be effective in attenuating runners' likelihood of developing a tibial stress fracture.

Content: Recent evidence has shown that surrogate measures, such as tibial acceleration and loading rates of the vertical ground reaction force, are not representative of tibial bone loading in running . Finite element modelling has been shown to provide more realistic estimates of in vivo tibial bone strains , directly linked to the aetiology of stress fractures . Indicating that this technique can be utilized to make informed predictions of the damage potential. Significant advances in finite element analyses made in recent years now allow computational probabilistic modelling of the tibia to be undertaken in order to quantify the probability of tibial stress fractures in runners utilizing different footwear modalities. However, neither of the aforementioned approaches has been utilized to examine differences between minimal, maximal and conventional running shoes during running. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of minimal, maximal and conventional running footwear on tibial strains and stress fracture probability via a collective finite element analysis and computational probabilistic modelling-based approach. The findings from this investigation will yield new information regarding the effects of minimal, maximal and conventional footwear on tibial strains during running, but also on longitudinal stress fracture probability. This investigation hypothesizes that minimal footwear will increase tibial strains and tibial stress fracture probability in relation to both conventional and maximal footwear.

Content: The aim of the current investigation was to examine the effects of minimal, maximal and conventional running footwear on tibial strains and stress fracture probability using a cumulative finite element analysis and computational modelling-based approach. This is the first examination of the effects of minimal, maximum and conventional footwear using a concurrent approach of the aforementioned techniques and may therefore yield new information regarding the effects of minimal, maximal and conventional footwear on tibial strains during running, but also on longitudinal stress fracture probability. This investigation tested the hypothesis that minimal footwear will increase tibial strains and tibial stress fracture probability compared to both conventional and maximal footwear. The current study showed, using musculoskeletal simulation, that ankle joint contact forces in the posterior, axial and medial directions were significantly greater in minimal footwear. To the authors' knowledge, this investigation is the first to examine threedimensional ankle joint contact loading in these footwear; however, this observation concurs with previous analyses adopting external indices as pseudo-measures of tibial loading . The strike index denoted that the minimal footwear was associated with a significantly more anterior and, on average, midfoot strike location . A more anterior strike location has been shown to increase the ankle plantarflexion moment and plantar flexor muscle forces . Therefore, the greater forces that were observed in the minimal footwear condition in the muscles crossing the ankle joint, i.e., medial and lateral gastrocnemius, were to be expected, and it is proposed that the increased ankle joint contact forces were mediated as a function of these enhanced muscle kinetics .

The current investigation examined fifteen males running in three footwear conditions (minimal, maximal and conventional). Kinematic data were collected during overground running at 4.0 m/s using an eight-camera motion-capture system and ground reaction forces using a force plate. Tibial strains were quantified using finite element modelling and stress fracture probability calculated via probabilistic modelling over 100 days of running. Ninetieth percentile tibial strains were significantly greater in minimal (4681.13 ) ( p &lt; 0.001) and conventional (4498.84 ) ( p = 0.007) footwear compared to maximal (4069.65 ). Furthermore, tibial stress fracture probability was significantly greater in minimal footwear (0.22) ( p = 0.047) compared to maximal (0.15). The observations from this investigation show that compared to minimal footwear, maximal running shoes appear to be effective in attenuating runners' likelihood of developing a tibial stress fracture.

Content: June 25, 2018 BEND, Ore. - Lower leg pain and injuries have long been a problem for runners, but research at Oregon State University-Cascades has shown that one type of running shoe may increase such risks for some runners. <!-- image --> Researchers in the Functional Orthopedic Research Center of Excellence (FORCE) Lab compared the biomechanics associated with 'maximal' and 'neutral' running shoes in tests with 15 female runners. The study concluded that runners experienced a higher impact peak and increased loading rate with the 'maximal' shoes. Increases in both factors are associated with a greater likelihood of injury, such as plantar fasciitis and tibial stress fractures. The study was published in The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine and is believed to be the first rigorous analysis of impacts associated with maximal shoes. Maximal running shoes feature increased cushioning, particularly in the forefoot region of the midsole, and have gained popularity since being introduced in 2010. More than 20 varieties of maximal shoes are on the market. Runners wearing maximal shoes, the researchers wrote, have reported feeling the extra cushion after running two to three miles. As a result, the researchers did not expect to find increases in impact peak or loading rate in runners wearing maximal shoes. In the FORCE Lab study, researchers evaluated the impacts on runners' feet and legs before and after a simulated 5,000 meter (about 3 miles) run on a treadmill. Each subject wore a neutral running shoe (New Balance 880) for one test and then, after a seven to 10-day waiting period, repeated the procedure with a maximal shoe (Hoke One One Bondi 4). In each test, 3D movements and forces were measured by monitoring reflective markers placed on the runners' shoes and legs and by having the subjects run over a 'force plate' that recorded the forces being applied as the runner's foot hit the surface.

Content: Stress fractures are representative of a mechanical fatigue phenomenon, whereby highmagnitude strains without sufficient rest between loading exposures are responsible for the initiation and progression of microscopic damage in the bony matrix, which ultimately results in injury . It is notable therefore in partial agreement with our hypotheses, that both strain magnitude and strained volume were significantly greater in the minimal and conventional footwear compared to maximal. It is proposed that this observation is related primarily to the aforementioned increases in three-dimensional ankle joint contact forces in the minimal footwear and medially directed contact forces in the conventional footwear. Furthermore, as the plantar flexor muscle forces, which facilitate posterior tibial bending, were significantly greater in the minimal and conventional footwear compared to maximal, it would also be expected that tibial strains due to bending would also be increased. Owing to the association between tibial strains and tibial bone damage, this investigation shows that minimal and conventional footwear appear to place runners at increased risk from the mechanical parameters linked to the aetiology of tibial stress fractures .

Content: In short, if you want to reduce shin splints, buy a new pair of shoes with a good amount of cushioning in them. In my personal opinion, a minimalist shoe is a bad idea for any other than the elite runners of our group. In fact, I know dozens of elite runners (sub-4-minute kilometers) and they ALL wear cushioned shoes. Go to your local running store that does proper gait analysis and have them put you in a pair of shoes that will protect your body from the high-impact sport that is running. Your form will develop on it's own, and is not a typical cause of shin splints anyways.

Content: Scrutinization of the ankle joint contact forces against previous analyses showed that they were similar to other analyses using musculoskeletal simulation techniques at similar running velocities . Similarly, the strains experienced by the tibia were also comparable to those observed by previous analyses at the same or similar running velocities . Finally, in relation to the tibial stress fracture probabilities, our values are consistent with other probabilistically derived failure rates at similar running speeds ; and importantly, the acceleration of risk over the first 40 days, as well as the overall incidence, is also consistent with the epidemiological literature for runners experiencing tibial stress fractures . However, like all research, this investigation is not without limitations. Firstly, whilst our finite element model was scaled to individual participant dimensions, person-specific bone geomorphologies and, indeed, material properties were not considered. As both tibial bone geometry and density influence tibial strains , the model adopted within this study may not have quantified tibial strains with complete accuracy. Importantly, sex is considered to be an independent risk factor for tibial stress fractures, and epidemiological literature has shown that females are at four times greater risk compared to males . It is not known whether our findings are generalizable to female runners, and it is therefore recommended that the effects of minimal, maximal and conventional footwear also be examined using probabilistic tibial stress fracture modelling in female runners. Finally, the lack of mechanical testing that may have yielded important information regarding key footwear biomechanical indices such as longitudinal bending stiffness, flexibility, friction and midsole hardness may also serve as a drawback to this study

Even with a minimalist shoe if you overdo it you'll get splints. I'd tend to stick with the advice of the shoe store and go with a supportive shoe, rest up and once the pain is gone ramp up your running slowly to let your muscles catch up.

'We were surprised by these results,' said Christine Pollard, director of the FORCE Lab and an associate professor of kinesiology. 'We thought we would see the opposite. Typically, increased cushioning results in a reduction in the impact peak and loading rate of the vertical ground reaction force. We suspect that the large amount of cushioning across the entire midsole caused the runners to rely more on the shoe than on their own internal structures to attenuate these forces.' The study also evaluated the degree of 'peak eversion,' the outward turning of the foot, a factor associated with injury risk. The researchers found no difference between the maximal and neutral shoes. The research is a first step in gathering evidence on the effects of maximal running shoes on runners' injury risks, said Pollard, who is also a licensed physical therapist. Maximal shoes are becoming very popular, but without controlled studies, clinicians have been unable to make science-based recommendations to runners. Pollard said she expects that a study with male runners might produce different results. 'We know that gender differences in running biomechanics do exist,' she added.

Content: Running is a highly accessible exercise modality associated with a plethora of physiological and psychological benefits. However, running is also associated with a very high incidence of chronic pathologies , with as many as 20-80% of runners experiencing such pathologies annually . Bone stress fractures represent one of the most commonly occurring chronic injuries in runners, accounting for as many as 30% of all running-related musculoskeletal injuries . The tibia has long been regarded as the most vulnerable site of stress fractures , with as many as 74% of all such injuries being observed at this location . Tibial stress fractures typically occur at the anterior diaphyseal region of this bone . Stress fractures are particularly problematic pathologies owing to their lengthy recovery period and high probability of re-injury . As a cyclical activity, running imposes continuous loads onto the skeletal system, which has the capacity to initiate bone fatigue . Strain is considered to be the closest analogue for actual structural damage to the bone itself . As in vivo strains during running have been shown to be considerably lower than the ultimate strength of bone, stress fracture pathologies are considered to be representative of a mechanical fatigue phenomenon , often expressed as an inverse power law association . Stress fractures transpire due to the accrual of microscopic damage within the bony matrix . Permitting sufficient rest between each running exposure allows time for bone remodelling, which may enhance bone integrity . However, if the rate of damage accrual is greater than that of bone remodelling and adaptation, small cracks may materialize in the bony matrix, <!-- image -->

Content: More recently, Kalkhoven et al 6 provided an important update to the Bertelsen framework by incorporating the tissue-specific microdamage that occurs from biomechanical loading and the ability of the athlete's underlying physiology to support tissue adaptation. The Kalkhoven framework applies an important concept long-known in tissue mechanics: cumulative biomechanical loads have a nonlinear relationship with cumulative tissue damage. For instance, a 10% increase in tissue stress/strain magnitudes results in a 50% reduction in the number of loading cycles (i.e., steps) before tissue failure. 7 This key, non-linear relationship may explain how a sudden addition of speedwork, for instance, can result in injury even if weekly running volume remains unchanged. 8 Yet, running injury prevention programs often view added training load as a linear issue, focusing more on training volume than loading magnitude. Since tissue is not an inert structure, consideration of the ability of the athlete's physiology to support tissue adaptation in response to loading is a critical component in understanding running injuries. Important physiological concepts, namely Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), have not had enough focus in prevention and treatment programs. The treatment of bone stress injuries in runners is emblematic of the problem of concentrating on an isolated risk factor (e.g., biomechanics) while ignoring other keystone contributors, such as energy availability. If energy availability is insufficient to support bone remodeling, addressing biomechanics or prescribing targeted bone loading exercises will likely have minimal therapeutic effect. 9

Content: Adopting a causal framework can greatly inform injury prevention and treatment efforts by tailoring a program to the runner's risk profile and recent training loads. Enhancing pre-run load capacity of the athlete via consistent, progressive loading (progressive strengthening, minimizing training spikes), addressing psychological stressors, and optimizing a runner's physiology is the first step. Second, considering the attributes of the individual runner (i.e., masters male vs adolescent female) and the ability of the athlete's physiology to support tissue remodeling will help inform physiological interventions and training load pre- scription. Tailoring training load prescription to address structure-specific cumulative microdamage should also be specific to past injuries or anatomical structures that are more likely to experience injury in specific sub-populations. For example, those recovering from, or at-risk for, Achilles tendinopathy should add speedwork into a training program judiciously, whereas downhill running should be added in slowly if recovering from, or at-risk for, patellofemoral pain. Wearable technologies can monitor injury-specific training loads (i.e., number of steps) while performing activities known to increase loading on injury-susceptible tissues, helping inform the need for recovery days <!-- image --> to restore pre-run load capacity and support tissue adaptation. Lastly, clinicians should adopt routine screening for RED-S and other physiological conditions known to reduce tissue adaptability and refer out for specialized care when indicated. We believe that by employing a causal framework of running injury aetiology that considers current theory in tissue mechanics and physiology, and by following general principles of injury risk management, the puzzle of running injury prevention and treatment has potential to be solved.

Content: According to certain authors, the protective effect of running may be associated with leg stiffness (K leg ) . Kleg has been proposed to be of substantial importance during sprinting, because it generates an increase in ground reaction forces that facilitate the storage and return of elastic energy, thus increasing the stride frequency and reducing ground contact time . Lower Kleg has been linked to inefficient storage and, in running kinematics and movement efficiency, is associated with an increased load on the contractile muscle units, which, in theory, also increases the risk of HSIs . The number of factors influencing mechanical stiffness during running (age, running technique, sporting background, fatigue, running distance, etc.) makes it difficult to formulate clear and general conclusions about training recommendations . Nevertheless, it remains evident that in order to attain optimal stiffness, this 'vaccine' must be tailored to the soccer context and adapted to the specific capabilities and running mechanics of the player . Otherwise, positive and protective adaptations will not be elicited. In addition, it should be noted that the relationship between sprint training and injury appearance is U-shaped, thus an inappropriate dose, insufficient or excessive, could increase the risk of injury significantly as well (Figure 1).

This includes: the principles of the ideal running stride, the role of the ankle as a universal joint, the normal or ideal running gait, structural foot deficiencies (the rigid and immobile 'clunk' foot and the hypermobile foot versus the normal foot), biomechanical structure and shoe design, and other structural deficiencies (bow legs, a quadriceps angle greater than 16...). In Chapter 3, 'Understanding the mind,' the psychological factors that determine a runner's response to injury are considered. Here, the point is made that the tools, e. g. the shoes and the orthotics, may not be sufficient to cure many runners. Some conventional remedies are useless as some runners can never heal because their problem may be more a mental than a physical one, a condition for which the authors have coined the term 'excessive pronation of the brain.' It is also shown that certain personal factors should be considered when treating injuries. These are: - the desire to be in control (injured runners whose wish is to be in control of their treatment require little more than simple advice, whereas injured runners who wish to be controlled require very precise and detailed instructions), - the level of self-esteem (e. g. athletes with a low self-confidence often require the doctor to take charge of their treatment),

Understanding the psychology of injury helps to understand why athletes respond to injuries in their own peculiar way.

Chapter 4, 'Preventing running injuries,' begins with a list of those factors that increase the risk of injury, for example: - gender (women have a broader hip structure than men and are thus more likely to have biomechanical abnormalities in the lower limbs that predispose to injury), - anatomical abnormalities, - heavy mass, - inappropriate shoes, - training errors, - inflexibility, - muscle imbalance, - failure to warm up. Subsequently this chapter focuses on several key strategies for preventing running injuries: choosing appropriate shoes, using sound training methods, stretching to promote muscle flexibility, exercising to strengthen the muscles and warming up.

This is why old shoes go on sale. Your shoes also have limited mileage, just like a car. For an average middle-of-the-road-cushioned shoe, this is about 300-500 miles.

Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique. Lower limb injury can be sustained by both the elite cyclist and the casual cyclist.

Content: Running Injuries comprises seven chapters: In Chapter 1, 'New insights into running injuries,' a distinction is made between extrinsic an intrinsic sports injuries. Extrinsic sports injuries result from the application of a single, irresistible force to the body, which causes the immediate onset of pain and disability. They occur especially in contact or collision-type sports. Intrinsic injuries do not originate from forces outside the body and their onset is typically gradual. These injuries are very often found in long-distance runners. The unique feature of running injuries is that they have an identifiable and treatable cause. The authors emphasise that until that cause is rectified, the conventional approach - rest, drugs, injections, and surgery - is an expensive waste of time. The first one to conclude this in the 1970s was marathonrunning cardiologist George Sheehan. He found out that treatment of running injury must take into account every possible contributory factor - the genetics, unique physiology and biomechanics of the individual, the environment (specifically the running surface), the type of shoe that is worn, and the training. This implies that a holistic view must be adopted and any or all of these factors must be corrected if an injury is to be prevented or cured. Against this background, the authors' aim is to provide runners with 1) an understanding of how their own genetic predispositions make them vulnerable to injury, 2) the means to remain injury-free, and 3) the hope of returning to their sport in the shortest possible time.

Content: - Runner's knee : Patellofemoral pain syndrome, commonly known as runner's knee, causes pain just behind or next to the kneecap. Discomfort often begins as mild pain that can worsen over time, especially when you put pressure on your knee. - Iliotibial band syndrome: The iliotibial band, or IT band, is a long piece of tissue that connects your outer hip to your knee. IT band syndrome happens when the IT band repetitively rubs against the leg bone, causing sharp pain on the outer part of your leg just above the knee. - Shin splints: Also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, shin splints cause pain along the shinbones in your lower legs. This injury frequently occurs when you increase your running volume too quickly. - Plantar fasciitis : The bottom of your foot contains a thick layer of tissue called fascia, which acts as a spring when you walk or run. Over time, intense running can lead to pain in your heel and the middle of your foot that can worsen after prolonged activity. - Stress fractures: Repetitive stress can cause hairline cracks to form in bones. Runners often get stress fractures in the heel, lower leg or top of the foot. - Achilles tendinitis: When your Achilles tendon, which connects your calf muscle to your heel, becomes inflamed, it can cause pain and swelling in your lower leg. - Ankle sprains: A sprain can result when you overstretch the muscle between your ankle and leg, which often happens by landing on the outside of your foot.

Content: Causal frameworks provide an important path forward for running injury prevention and treatment efforts by considering how training loads interact with modifiers (i.e., risk factors). Bertelsen et al 4 introduced a causal framework for the aetiology of running injuries that identified the complex interplay of training load (i.e., number of running steps) with the distribution of biomechanical loading across anatomical structures, magnitude of internal biomechanical loads, and an anatomical structure's capacity to tolerate the load. For instance, male masters runners have an elevated risk for Achilles tendinopathy due in large part to age-related reductions in Achilles tendon stiffness. 5 Rapid increases in hill running or speedwork distribute a greater degree of biomechanical loads on the Achilles tendon, potentially resulting in an injurious training load in the masters runner. Importantly, runners who are not at-risk for Achilles tendinopathy, such as adolescent runners, may not experience the same injury under similar training loads. A critical concept in Bertelsen's causal framework is that a runner's biomechanics distributes the loads to various structures, but an injury will not result without a training load error coupled with a compromised load capacity of the anatomical structure.

Content: Expertsrecommend the following strategies to prevent injuries: - Identify your running goals. You may choose to start running to improve your figure, lose weight, increase cardiovascular fitness, or socialize with friends. Whatever the reason, it's a good idea to identify this goal when creating your exercise program. If you want to improve cardiovascular fitness, for instance, you should run at a quick pace to maximize your heart rate. If you're running to lose weight or reduce body fat, it's better to run at a slower rate for a longer time. Depending on your goal, your healthcare provider or personal trainer may decide that a modest walking or jogging program is appropriate. Setting goals helps you follow a safe pace and keeps you from overexertion, which can result in injury. - Have a physical evaluation. Certain health problems may hamper your running performance and increase your risk for injury. Specifically, osteoporosis, arthritis, and other degenerative joint diseases can increase your injury risk.If you have any significant health issues, youshould discuss these with your healthcare provider before you start to run. - Warm up before you run and stretch after you run. Doing so can prevent some of the most common injuries. It's most important to stretch muscles that moveyour leg and anklejoints. These include the calf muscle, which moves the knee and ankle, and the hamstring, which moves the knee and hip. Walk or gently jog for5 minutes. Cool down at the same pace for another 5 minutes at the end of your run. - Wear the correct shoes. Buyrunningshoes at an athletic store, where a salesclerk can help you choose a shoe that fits your foot type. This can help prevent injuries.

Additional emphasis on low-value interventions such as footwear to prevent injury often detracts from more effective prevention strategies. 3 Not surprisingly, most running injury prevention programs fail to reduce running injury rates and, in the case of advising on running biomechanics, may actually increase the risk of running injury. 1 The purpose of this international perspective is to describe how a causal framework approach can help to prevent and treat running injuries.

Content: According to , a stiffer landing technique significantly increases the risk of developing overuse and acute lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. The problematic techniques identified include a heel-strike position, greater ankle inversion, greater knee dynamic abduction, reduced hip flexion angle, higher external hip rotation strength, and reduced hip abduction strength. Players with ACL injuries had hip flexion angles below 20 o at initial contact, which were significantly more common in females compared to males . In addition, injured athletes exhibited significantly lower hip abduction strength and higher external hip rotation strength compared to non-injured athletes, suggesting that reduced hip abduction strength is associated with a higher risk of ACL injury . According to knee biomechanics, reduced knee flexion angle ( 20 o ) at initial contact and greater knee moments are key risk factors for knee injuries, while a higher peak knee flexion angle decreases this risk . Increasing dynamic knee valgus angle is a critical factor in knee injury during landing. Players with knee injuries exhibited an 8.4 o greater knee valgus angle at initial contact and significant increases in peak knee abduction moment, significantly elevating the risk of knee injuries . Regarding ankle biomechanics, the injured player landed in a heel-strike position with a mean dorsiflexion of 2 o at initial contact and transitioned to a flat-foot position over the next 20 ms, increasing the plantarflexion angle by an average of 12 o . Moreover, ankle inversion during landing significantly increases the risk of lateral ankle injuries, which account for over 80% of such injuries . This inward rotation of the ankle can damage the lateral collateral ligaments, particularly the anterior tibiofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. Ankle sprains are more likely when the ankle is in greater inversion.

In Chapter 5, 'The ten laws of running injuries,' the authors once again stress that it is absolutely crucial to understand the reason for a running injury and that it serves no purpose to diagnose the injury correctly if no attention is paid to the cause. If nothing is done to eliminate the cause of the injury, the injury is quite likely to recur, possibly more serious than before. Chapter 5 is therefore intended to allow injured runners to reflect on why their injury occurred. For this reflection the consideration of the following 'ten laws of running injuries' may be helpful: 1. Running injuries are not a act of God. (Instead they result from the interaction of the athlete's genetic structure with the environment through training methods.) 2. Each injury progresses through four grades. (Pain after exercise, discomfort during exercise, pain during exercise, pain that prevents any attempts at running) 3. Each injury indicates a breakdown point. (This law simply emphasises that once an injury has occurred, it is time to analyse why the injury happened.) 4. Most true running injuries are curable. 5. Sophisticated methods are seldom necessary to diagnose injury. 6. Treat the cause, not the effect. 7. Complete rest is seldom the most appropriate treatment. 8. Never accept as final the advice of a non-runner (medical doctor or other). 9. Avoid surgery. 10. There is little evidence that recreational running causes osteoarthritis.

Content: strong and coordinated muscle activation across the hip, knee, and ankle joints stabilizes these areas and absorbs impact forces effectively. Finally, balanced force distribution across the lower limb joints prevents overloading any single joint, thereby reducing the risk of overuse injuries. It is also important to avoid landing with a heel-strike position, excessive ankle inversion, greater knee dynamic abduction, inadequate hip flexion angle, higher external hip rotation strength, and insufficient hip abduction strength to further reduce injury risks . Prevention training programs, therefore, should focus on hip abductor strength, core stability, knee stability, and proper ankle positioning during landing to reduce injury risks. Additionally, neuromuscular activities such as warm-up exercises, plyometrics, and balance training have proven effective in reducing lower extremity injuries. Warm-up exercises have been shown to reduce perceived muscle soreness after exercise and prevent exercise-related injuries [51, 53]. Integrating both static and dynamic stretching can improve flexibility, reduce muscle stiffness, and lower the risk of acute muscle injuries . In contrast, active cool down does not appear to diminish the long-term adaptive response or prevent injury . Our findings show that only one-third of the participants always warmed up before playing badminton, which may explain the high incidence of injuries observed. Emphasizing the importance of warm-ups is crucial for senior players. Sport-specific plyometric exercises not only improve change-of-direction speed, enhance agility, muscle strength, and overall performance but also play a crucial role in injury prevention [55, 56]. Proprioceptive training programs significantly enhance neuromuscular control and joint stability, effectively reducing the incidence of ankle injuries

Content: The development of Runner's Knee can be attributed to a range of factors: - Overuse and Repetitive Stress : Activities that involve a lot of knee bending - like jogging, squatting, and biking - can lead to overuse injuries in the knee. Repetitive stress on the knee joint can irritate the nerves of the patella and strain the tendons. - Muscle Imbalance and Weakness : Weak quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip muscles can contribute to Runner's Knee. These imbalances can cause the patella to track improperly along the femoral groove, leading to increased stress and pain. - Biomechanical Issues : Problems with foot alignment, including flat feet or overpronation, can affect the way forces are transmitted through the leg, impacting the knee joint. - Direct Trauma to the Knee : A direct hit to the knee can lead to Runner's Knee, as it can disturb the alignment or the balance of forces on the patella. Understanding these causes is crucial for both prevention and treatment. It's important to note that Runner's Knee is typically more common in females than males, possibly due to differences in muscle strength and pelvic width.

Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. If you have questions, contact the referring physician. Also referred to as Iliotibial band friction syndrome, this pathology refers to lateral thigh/knee pain, typically distal, along the area where the ITB slides over the lateral femoral condyle at approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion. This can be common for activities that require repetitive knee flexion and extension.

Content: The iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a frequent overuse injury in both runners and cyclists (20,23,36) . During flexion and extension of the knee the position of the iliotibial band changes relative to the lateral femur condyle. At the bottom of the pedal stroke, around 30 of knee flexion, the posterior fibres of the ITB are located over the lateral condyle near the edge of the impingement zone. Farrell et al. concluded that, although cyclists spent less time in the impingement zone at a lower force, the number of repetitions is the primary contributor to the development of ITBS in cyclists (21) . Athletes usually complain of a stabbing lateralsided knee pain, arising during the course of a ride. Two patients suffered from iliotibial band syndrome in our cohort. Clinical examination reveals a local tenderness over the posterior fibres of the ITB with a positive Noble's test. The Ober test is used to evaluate ITB tightness. Although ITBS is a mainly clinical diagnosis, medical imaging such as ultrasound and MRI can aid in the diagnosis by showing the presence of fluid in the underlying bursa (Fig.5).

Content: <!-- image --> Two UCI U23 in our cohort suffered from ITB syndrome, both diagnoses were confirmed on MRI. Treatment for ITBS mainly consists of conservative measures. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors can predispose an athlete to developing ITBS. Contributing intrinsic factors are leg length discrepancy, primary ITB tightness, external tibial rotation of more than 20, varus knee alignment and foot overpronation (24) . Extrinsic factors should be addressed first, such as adjusting the bike fit and/or cleat positioning. A saddle position too high or too far back may increase the stretch on the ITB. A cleat which is too externally rotated (cycling toed-in) or lateral placed (adducted leg) may also cause ITBS. A short period of rest is often advised together with stretching of the ITB. Local infiltration with corticoid can give temporary relief but should be used with caution. If extensive conservative treatment fails, iliotibial band bursectomy (22) is an option. Both patients in our series underwent this surgery and returned to their previous level of racing.

With ITB tightness, the patient may demonstrate a positive Ober test. 20 Common anatomic variants found on examination include varus knee alignment, internal tibia rotation, and foot hyperpronation. Cleat position, along with orthoses or wedges, may help address internal tibia rotation and foot hyperpronation. Lowering the seat below the typical height reduces the amount of knee extension and tension across the ITB. Placing the cyclist in a more upright position by raising the handlebars and/or moving the seat forward reduces hip flexion, thus releasing tension on the gluteus maximus and, in turn, the ITB. Stretching of the ITB and the gluteus maximus is essential in addressing ITB syndrome, as are rest, NSAIDs, and local corticosteroid injection. For the patient with refractory ITB syndrome, surgical management may involve excision of the bursa and/or release/resection of the ITB. 21 Hip pain in the cyclist is typically caused by trochanteric bursitis and iliopsoas tendinitis. In both cases, the exacerbating factor usually is riding with the bike seat too high.

Content: Rehabilitation can be divided in three phases. In the first one, the goals are to protect scar development and minimize muscle atrophy. Excessive lengthening of the hamstrings, which would aggravate the initial lesion, should be avoided, and ice should be applied 2 to 3 times a day. Patients should develop the ability to walk and perform daily tasks without pain and perform prone knee flexion with minimal resistance. The second phase focuses on regaining pain-free, mid-range, hamstring strength, while still avoiding end-range lengthening of the muscles. Movement speed should be increased progressively to develop neuromuscular control over the injured limb. Ice should be applied 10 to 15 minutes after exercise. Before passing onto the next phase, patients should be capable of jogging in moderate intensity, as well as performing full strength prone knee flexion without pain. In the third and last phase, the patient's goal is to be symptom-free during all activities. Normal concentric and eccentric hamstring strength through full range of motion and speeds should be achieved. Patients should avoid full intensity exercises if pain, tightness or stiffness are present. Post-exercise ice should be applied only if necessary. To match the criteria for returning to sports, patients should be able to perform full strength activities, have full range of motion and replicate sport specific movements near full speed, without pain.[42, 43] Other options such as ultrasound stimulation, cold and heat compressors, and massaging have been considered as treatments for hamstring injuries, but there are no studies with results to validate them as being better than placebo.[17, 19]

Content: Hip pain in the cyclist is typically caused by trochanteric bursitis and iliopsoas tendinitis. In both cases, the exacerbating factor usually is riding with the bike seat too high. This results in undue tension on both the ITB and the iliopsoas tendon. The bike seat should be lowered to allow 30 to 35 of knee flexion at the bottom of the pedal cycle. Nonsurgical management involves stretching of the respective structure, along with rest, ice, NSAIDs, and local steroid injection, as needed. Iliopsoas tendinitis also may be closely connected to low back pain; a tight psoas muscle can inhibit the transversus abdominis, internal obliquus, and gluteus maximus. 22,23 This, in turn, causes decreased hip mobility.

Management usually involves activity modification (specifically, nonimpact activity to maintain cardiovascular fitness until the pain is resolved), along with NSAIDs, stretching, and antipronation taping to correct excessive pronation of the foot. 26 Strengthening exercises may include isometrics and foot intrinsics, with progression to eccentric dorsiflexion for deceleration control of the anterior tibialis.

Multiple aspects of knee function and proprioception (e.g., LSIO, DAP, LSIAP, NML, LSIML) were improved after the intervention. Though as compared PT, significantly greater benefits of CT were observed only for LSIT and LSIS, the results of this pilot study suggest that CT can at least induce comparable benefits to that by PT-only intervention, providing critical knowledge of study design, sample size estimation for future large-scale randomized trials. We observed that compared to PT, CT significantly improved LSIT and LSIs but not on LSIC and LSIO. LSIT, and LSIs mainly reflect knee functions and limb symmetry for the continuous hopping process of the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) (Fitzgerald et al., 2000). For example, Zwolski et al.

Injury prevention should be the focus, with particular attention to bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, proper rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training.

The increased number of bicyclists has led to increased numbers of associated injuries. 2,3 Traumatic injury occurs as a result of overuse injury from repetitive motion and from unexpected motion. Overuse injury is caused by repetitive loading of bone, joint, and soft tissue with inadequate recovery time. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury potential. Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique. Lower limb injury can be sustained by both the elite cyclist and the casual cyclist.

Content: LSIO only reflects muscle strength of single-leg and limb symmetry between legs, and LSIC reflects the capacity of imposing forces in frontal and transverse planes with multiple hops in the sagittal plane, which is a more techniquedemanding condition (Logerstedt et al., 2012). The traditional PT focuses only on enhancing the musculoskeletal function and consolidating the movement pattern of landing, which may thus particularly benefit the LSIC and LSIO. The balance training of CT protocol focuses on multiple abilities of balance and stability including the posterior thigh muscles, the abdominal muscles, and the hip muscles, especially improving the stability of ankle during the process of landing and take-off (Hewett et al., 2010). Hariri and Sadeghi (2018) found that it was necessary to increase the speed of the knee in order to achieve maximum foot speed toward the target in the performance of the Karate. Improving muscle performance and joint movement is thus of great importance in quick movement during badminton matches, especially in enhancing knee function. CT intervention thus can simultaneously target lower limb strength, knee function, and movement pattern of landing, and can improve both power and agility of badminton players (Fischetti et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2021). It may thus induce significantly greater improvements specifically in LSIT and LSIs (but not LSIC and LSIO) by targeting SSC and dynamic stability of knees, suggesting particular benefits from CT on dynamic stability of knees. However, as compared to PT, no significant improvements in proprioception as assessed by COP outcomes induced by CT were observed, suggesting CT induced benefits for proprioception which are only comparable to PT.

For surgical patients, rehabilitation exercises typically begin 2 to 4 weeks postop. In the past decade, there has been a trend towards less rigid immobilization, earlier weight-bearing, and accelerated functional rehabilitation following surgery. Post-immobilization therapy consists of exercise progression, including ankle range of motion exercises, resistive and progressive strengthening exercises, isometric exercises, cardiovascular exercises, and balance exercises as appropriate. A standardized accelerated protocol following a surgical repair of the Achilles tendon has not been published, and a better level of evidence studies is needed to evaluate risks vs. benefits. Exercise focus is typically low impact for the first 6 months, with high-impact exercises incorporated after 6 months, emphasizing a return to sport as appropriate. Data has shown a need for a heavy focus on calf strengthening within the first year of injury as a reduction in strength gain potential has been demonstrated beyond the one-year post-injury date.

Content: The rehabilitation of cyclists with knee pain or overuse injury requires a full understanding of the mechanism that Powered by TCPDF (w w.tcpdf.org) triggers the overuse injury. In the case of the knee joint, it is difficult to establish conclusive recommendations because only a couple of patterns have been observed to differ between injured and uninjured cyclists. The medial projection of the knee and the changes in activation for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles could indicate 2 main options. The first would involve an assessment of force and mobility for hip adductors and abductors, which could provide evidence of potential imbalance of a given muscle group. However, we must keep in mind that this is very speculative given there is a lack of evidence in this area. The second option would involve the assessment of activation of vastus medialis in relation to vastus lateralis, which could help controlling the position of the patella in relation to the femur. Although patients with delayed onset of vastus medialis could be more prone to develop or sustain anterior knee pain, the literature is not conclusive in this area. 35 Therefore, treatment involving an enhanced activation of the vastus medialis should be a secondary option.

However, from what I can tell these are very common cases with runners, especially with beginning runners who have just started developing their leg muscles. <!-- image --> <!-- image --> With regard to the knee pain, it is most likely either Runners Knee or Iliotibial Band Syndrome as these are the two most common injuries ( ). There are several ways you can gradually rehabilitate your knee over time to remove the current pain and prevent future pain. see active.com article for more info - Make sure your shoes offer proper support for your feet. - Properly stretch your legs before running. - Make sure you use proper form when running. - Make sure there isn't an imbalance in your leg muscles by equally training them all (running does a lot for the hamstring, but not a lot for the quads). - Reduce your mileage to prevent "overuse." Runner's Knee can come as a result of increasing your mileage too quickly; try going back to your 1-2 minute run 1-2 minute walk because your body might not be ready for much more than that (yet). - Ice your knee and take anti-inflammatory drugs (ex. ibuprofen) whenever you exerpience knee pain. With regard to the shin pain, this is almost certainly shin splints ( ). The shin splints most likely came about because you increased your mileage too quickly, and as a result your muscles weren't strong enough to absorb the stress from running while fatigued. The same remedies for Runners Knee apply here, so make sure you stretch, workout the whole leg, have proper footware, and so on. see wikipedia article <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 3 <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 2 <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 1

Content: Most hamstring injuries respond well to conservative management. The main priority of the non-surgical treatment is to control the pain and decrease inflammation caused by the acute injury. There is, however, no full consensus on what the conservative treatment should consist in.[22, 25] The most agreed on and valid treatment is RICE - rest, ice, compression, elevation. It restrains the initial inflammatory response and helps control edema and haemorrhage. Despite that, recent studies have exposed its limitation. One of the main concerns is that a long resting phase longer than 72 hours can lead to a bigger loss of muscle strength and flexibility and can delay the return to normal function. It is thought that an earlier and gradual return to activity is related to a rapid recovery. Consequently, the POLICE protocol - protection, optimal load, ice, compression, elevation - has shown better results. Optimal load means gradually replacing rest with a balanced and incremental amount of physical activity. This also contributes towards better regeneration and orientation of the injured muscle fibres.[27, 28] Protection provided by crutches, braces or other supports is also highly recommended to avoid further injury to the affected site. It is necessary to point out that the non-surgical approach to treating hamstring injuries is dependent on its severity - for example, more extensive injuries to the muscle and soft tissue may experience a longer period of recovery.[8, 24] Considering this high discrepancy, there isn't a fixed time protocol that can be applied, but rather a recovery program tailored to the patient's symptoms and level of pain, to ensure an adequate rehabilitation, focusing on strengthening and regain of function. Returning to activity prematurely may submit patients to a high risk of reinjury.[22, 29]

Content: Finally it has been suggested that the implementation of these programs improves stability, technical skills, and movement control (Riva et al., 2016). The exercises used for this section of the injury prevention circuit are usually dynamic joint stability exercises such as low level plyometric exercises, agility drills and sport-specific exercises (Risberg et al., 2001; Mandelbaum et al., 2005; Hewett et al., 2011). Prevention exercises are usually exercises that focus more on preventing soccer specific injury. These exercises implemented should be scientifically based &amp; efficiently assist in the reduction of muscle strains in lower body muscles. Exercises used by practitioners around the world usually include eccentric actions with an increasing load every week to improve player's strength levels (https://www.isspf.com/certificatein-strength-conditioning-for-football-performance/). The Nordic exercises for hamstrings are common place and very well established in literature, the Copenhagen adductor exercise combined with the reverse Nordic for quadriceps overloads are also really good examples of research based exercises used in this stage. (https://www.isspf.com/) <!-- image --> <!-- image --> Conclusion Although lots of resources, research and interest surround the injury in soccer narrative, it is a growing problem that is still increasing in the elite world of soccer. (https://www.isspf.com/) Many clubs with increased demands of success or financial constraints have to deal with greater performance and financial problems, as high injury rates are correlated with those two aspects. As a practitioner at the professional level of the game, it is crucial for every club to have an 'Injury Prevention or Reduction Philosophy' that can reduce the probabilities of injury happening.

Content: One such strategy is plyometric training (PT), of which the goal is to improve lower limb strength, knee function (e.g., isokinetic muscle strength test and single-legged hop tests), and movement pattern of landing (e.g., depth jump and continuous jump) (Hewett et al., 2010) by shortening muscle eccentric-concentric contraction cycle [also termed as a stretch-shortening cycle (SSC)] (Markovic and Mikulic, 2010; Ramirez-dela Cruz et al., 2022). Studies have shown that PT can enhance the sport performance of athletes, such as strength (Asadi, 2012), running economy (do Carmo et al., 2022), agility (Maciejczyk et al., 2021), and sprint ability (Markovic and Mikulic, 2010), as well as reducing ACL injury risk. Alikhani et al. (2019) observed that, for example, 6week PT significantly improved dynamic balance and knee proprioception in female badminton players by enhancing their functional adaptations and neural recruitment of motor units that activate appropriate muscles before landing and the proprioceptive inputs. More recently, studies have emerged to combine PT with other training programs and observed that this combined training (CT) can significantly augment the benefits of using PT Therefore, this pilot randomized controlled study aims to characterize the effects of a 6-week CT with balance training and plyometric training on knee function and proprioception in a group of elite badminton players and examine if this kind of CT can induce greater benefits as compared to PT. Participants completed the CT and PT of the same training protocol as validated in our previous studies (Guo et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022). Specifically, we hypothesize that the CT protocol would induce a significant increase in performance (e.g., single-legged hop tests and center of pressure) pertaining to knee function and proprioception compared to PT.

Content: Implementation of a Structured Warm-up and Cool-down Programme: A thorough warm-up before training or competition and an adequate cool-down process afterwards can reduce the risk of injury. The programme should include specific exercises that increase blood flow to the muscles and improve flexibility, especially in areas most commonly affected by injury. Body Awareness and Balance Training: Improving body awareness and balance through proprioceptive exercises can strengthen players' ability to control their movements and reduce the risk of falling or moving unnaturally, which can lead to injury. Use of Evidence-Based Rehabilitation Techniques: Healthcare professionals should adopt rehabilitation techniques that are supported by current scientific evidence. This includes manual therapy, strengthening and flexibility exercises, and the use of rehabilitation technologies such as biofeedback and laser therapy. Player Education: Educating players on the importance of following rehabilitation protocols, early recognition of injury symptoms, and injury prevention strategies is key to ensuring quick and effective recovery and preventing re-injury. Personalising Rehabilitation Protocols: Recognising that every athlete and injury is unique, it is crucial to tailor the rehabilitation programme to each individual's specific needs, including considering the type of injury, severity, and sporting goals of the player. Multidisciplinary Team Collaboration: Close cooperation between coaches, physiotherapists, sports psychologists and other healthcare professionals can speed up the recovery process and ensure a holistic approach to injury rehabilitation. Adopting this approach in daily practice will help maximise player well-being and minimise downtime due to injury, allowing them to return to the field faster and in the best condition possible.

Content: The rehabilitation of cyclists with knee pain or overuse injury requires a full understanding of the mechanism that triggers the overuse injury. In the case of the knee joint, it is difficult to establish conclusive recommendations because only a couple of patterns have been observed to differ between injured and uninjured cyclists. The medial projection of the knee and the changes in activation for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles could indicate 2 main options. The first would involve an assessment of force and mobility for hip adductors and abductors, which could provide evidence of potential imbalance of a given muscle group. However, we must keep in mind that this is very speculative given there is a lack of evidence in this area. The second option would involve the assessment of activation of vastus medialis in relation to vastus lateralis, which could help controlling the position of the patella in relation to the femur. Although patients with delayed onset of vastus medialis could be more prone to develop or sustain anterior knee pain, the literature is not conclusive in this area. 35 Therefore, treatment involving an enhanced activation of the vastus medialis should be a secondary option.

Certain biomechanical aspects need to be considered to ensure injury-free, goal-oriented cycling. The rehabilitation of any of the lower extremity joints is often geared toward increasing the joint's range of motion and strength. Cycling can augment rehabilitation and help control certain lower extremity stresses. Whether recreational cycling is a progression from rehabilitation or a long-term fitness activity, it may be the role of the physical therapist to advise patients on biomechanical aspects, including seat height, pedaling rate, and/or pedal position. These considerations become particularly important for the competitive or cross training cyclist who focuses on overall efficiency. The purpose of this review is to discuss topics such as optimal seat height, pedal position, pedaling rate, force application and symmetry, and the muscle actions necessary for proper joint excursions in cycling.

Although quadriceps tendinitis maypresent as medial or lateral knee pain, it is commonly lateral in the cyclist. The diagnosis of quadriceps tendinitis may be confused with ITB syndrome or patellofemoral syndrome. Physical examination should readily reveal tenderness over the quadriceps tendon, which aids in diagnosis. Varus or valgus misalignment of the knees can cause excessive stress on the quadriceps tendon; such misalignment is best addressed with orthoses, wedges, and/or cleat position. A seat position too low or too far forward also precipitates this condition. Rest, NSAIDs, and ice, along with a reduction in training intensity, should be implemented until symptoms resolve.

Hamstring stretching may help to relieve the pressure across the pes anserine bursa. Physical therapy may help in resolving muscle imbalance, and the patient may benefit from application of low-pulse laser and ultrasound.

The main goals of the rehabilitation protocol are to return the athlete to activity at a pre-injury level of performance and to minimize risk of reinjury, focusing on eccentric and proprioceptive exercises. Each individual should have an injury tailored rehabilitation plan. Further studies will help to define and optimize a protocol for the treatment and rehabilitation of these lesions.

Content: Common Approaches in Rehabilitation: A Review of Principles Injury rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of an athlete's recovery after injury, especially in intense sports such as badminton. The approach involves a series of steps designed to ensure effective and efficient recovery, reduce the risk of re-injury, and allow players to return to their peak performance. The basic principles of injury rehabilitation include rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE), followed by physical therapy and strengthening exercises aimed at restoring function, strength and mobility of the injured area ( Sara Horvat , 2024). Rest is the initial and perhaps most important step in the rehabilitation process. It not only refers to the cessation of the activity that caused the injury but also includes activity modification to avoid stressing the injured area. The application of ice immediately after the injury occurs can help reduce inflammation and pain, while compression and elevation contribute to the reduction of swelling (Kwiecien, 2023). After the initial phase of recovery, physical therapy plays an important role in injury rehabilitation. It involves a series of exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility and stability without overloading the injured area. The physical therapy approach should be individualised, considering the type of injury and the specific needs of the player (Carreno et al., 2021). Strengthening exercises are another important component of injury rehabilitation. It not only focuses on the injured area but also on strengthening the surrounding muscles and support structures to prevent re-injury. Research has shown that a structured exercise programme can significantly reduce the risk of re-injury and improve athletic performance (Dijksma et al., 2020).

Content: Results: The knee function and proprioception were assessed at baseline and after the intervention by measuring the performance of single-legged hop tests (LSIO, LSIT, LSIC, LSIS), standing postural sway (COPAP, COPML), and LSI of dominant leg and non-dominant leg. The results showed that as compared to PT, CT induced significantly greater improvements in LSIT and LSIS ( p &lt; 0.001) and significant greater percent increase in NAP ( p D 0.011). The changes in LSIO, LSIC, DAP, NAP, LSIAP, DML, NML, and LSIML induced by CT did not differ from that induced by PT ( p &gt; 0.213). Conclusion: In elite badminton players, intervention using CT holds great promise to augment the benefits for knee function compared to the intervention using PT only, and at the same time, with at least comparable benefits for proprioception. Future studies are needed to examine and confirm the results of this study. KEYWORDS plyometric exercise, physical conditioning, knee, postural balance, badminton

Content: Adopting a causal framework can greatly inform injury prevention and treatment efforts by tailoring a program to the runner's risk profile and recent training loads. Enhancing pre-run load capacity of the athlete via consistent, progressive loading (progressive strengthening, minimizing training spikes), addressing psychological stressors, and optimizing a runner's physiology is the first step. Second, considering the attributes of the individual runner (i.e., masters male vs adolescent female) and the ability of the athlete's physiology to support tissue remodeling will help inform physiological interventions and training load pre- scription. Tailoring training load prescription to address structure-specific cumulative microdamage should also be specific to past injuries or anatomical structures that are more likely to experience injury in specific sub-populations. For example, those recovering from, or at-risk for, Achilles tendinopathy should add speedwork into a training program judiciously, whereas downhill running should be added in slowly if recovering from, or at-risk for, patellofemoral pain. Wearable technologies can monitor injury-specific training loads (i.e., number of steps) while performing activities known to increase loading on injury-susceptible tissues, helping inform the need for recovery days <!-- image --> to restore pre-run load capacity and support tissue adaptation. Lastly, clinicians should adopt routine screening for RED-S and other physiological conditions known to reduce tissue adaptability and refer out for specialized care when indicated. We believe that by employing a causal framework of running injury aetiology that considers current theory in tissue mechanics and physiology, and by following general principles of injury risk management, the puzzle of running injury prevention and treatment has potential to be solved.

Content: The clinical presentation of a hamstring injury may vary depending on the grade, location, and mechanism of injury. An acute hamstring injury usually presents itself with an abrupt, sharp pain in the posterior aspect of the thigh, which can be associated with the onset of ecchymosis. This sudden pain can be concomitant to an audible pop and a substantial loss of strength in the affected limb. Following this injury, patients may avoid movements such as hip and knee flexion to reduce pain, and load bearing will be affected. This makes it very difficult to continue sporting activities and, in some cases, common every day activities such as walking, sitting and standing up will be affected.[5, 17-19] In case of a complete tear of the myotendinous junction, there may be palpable muscle defects, such as lumps, associated to ecchymosis. These can be felt and seen upon contraction. Patients with an isolated biceps femoris rupture may feel localized pain in the lateral or posterolateral area of the thigh. Patients who suffer mild strains are less likely to seek medical attention since the symptoms typically are alleviated within a few days following the injury.

Content: Hamstring strains are the most common soccer muscle injury accounting for up to 50% of muscle injuries. They tend to be more common in males than females and the most common game situations in which a hamstring is injured is in high speed running activities during terminal swing phase and during a kicking motion when there is simultaneous hip flexion and knee extension. About a third of athletes who suffer a hamstring strain will experience a re-injury within a year of returning to their sport. The greatest risk of re-injury is in the first two weeks following return to play , and the second injury is usually more severe than the initial strain . Factors contributing to the high rate of recurring hamstring strain injuries include... 1. Persistent weakness 2. Reduced extensibility of the musculotendonous unit 3. Compensatory movement patterns and biomechanics 4. Improperly addressing the modifiable risk factors that led to the initial injury, and 5. Returning to play prematurely. The key to effective prevention of any injury is understanding its modifiable risk factors . For a hamstring strain, a case can be made for hamstring weakness, impaired flexibility of hamstrings and quads, strength and coordination deficits of pelvic and trunk muscles, and impaired lumbopelvic rhythm all playing a role in hamstring strain injury risk. However, the modifiable risk factor most supported by research is eccentric hamstring strength . When a player shoots the ball and is going into hip flexion and knee extension, the hamstrings must have enough eccentric strength to be able to control the rate of knee extension being produced concentrically by the quads. If the quads have significantly more concentric strength than the hamstrings do eccentric strength, then the knee will be extending too quickly for the hamstrings to

These have become a matter of rising importance because the time off an athlete must take from his career is very costly for himself and his team and can affect his future performance. Hamstring injuries can be any strain or tear of any of the muscles or tendons within the hamstring group. Despite being a common injury, the optimal treatment is still controversial and is heavily dependent on the severity of the injury. This review summarizes the epidemiology, risk factors, anatomy and physiology, before tackling the current approach to diagnosing and treating the injury.

Content: Like in every other musculoskeletal injury, inspection, palpation, range of motion and strength should be assessed. Firstly, gait abnormalities, such as limping and reduced hip movements, should be noticed. Patients should then lie in the prone position, where each of the three hamstring muscles should be palpated from origin to insertion, particularly the origin at the ischial tuberosity, to check for avulsion. However, due to their deep location, it is often difficult to determine the exact nature of the injury upon physical examination.[8, 20, 22] Hamstring injuries typically manifest themselves with swelling and ecchymosis localized to the posterior side of the thigh and, in cases of a more extensive injury, haematoma. Range of motion and strength of the affected hamstring muscle should be examined by testing knee flexion with resistance applied at the heel, with the knee at 15 and 90 of flexion to evaluate eccentric and concentric contractions, accordingly. Testing shall be performed on both sides and comparing it to the contralateral, uninjured, side is of the utmost importance. Weakness and pain noticed during examination are positive findings and should be followed by further examination with the resource of medical imaging.[3, 22]

Content: Hamstring injuries are a common factor in most prolonged pauses from training and competition in athlete's careers and usually more than one muscle is involved. Anatomically, hamstring injuries occur most frequently in the myotendinous junction, where muscle and tendon fibres intersect. Injuries are most likely to occur when hamstrings are stretched - hip flexion combined with knee extension - during eccentric contraction, therefore they are more prevalent in sports such as soccer, football, running and water-skiing, where sprinting, running and/or rapid changes of direction are required.[3, 6, 7] Hamstring strains and partial tear are the most frequently occurring form of injury, whereas complete ruptures are less common. Less frequent are avulsion injuries, where the hamstring tendon tears from the bone. Proximal injuries are more common than distal injuries regardless of which muscles are involved.

The complex and multifactorial nature of this injury makes it difficult to attribute its appearance based on an isolated risk factor . We know that, although in most cases it appears during high-speed efforts and sprints , there are several factors that could cause it. Some of these factors include: inadequate management of training loads , inadequate weekly exposure to high-speed running , the existence of previous injury , neuromuscular fatigue , low levels of force (isometric, concentric and eccentric) , poor lumbopelvic control and improper sprint mechanics . These are some of the main factors that could cause HSIs , but especially, as some authors point out, there is a lack of multicomponent programs, where all the aforementioned factors should be taken into consideration .

Content: Muscle injuries are the most frequent traumas occurring in sports, and among those, the hamstrings are the most commonly affected. Hamstring injuries often cause pain and dysfunction, as well as the inability to return to practice and competition. The severity of the injury determines the management and the amount of time an athlete must take off, which can be very costly to his career. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment is crucial for optimizing the recovery and minimizing the time spent inactive. Most injuries have an indication for being managed conservatively and studies have shown very positive outcomes. The use of growth factors to aid muscle rehabilitation has been growing in popularity -Platelet-rich plasma, platelet-rich fibrin and corticosteroids have been the subject of many recent studies on this matter. Up to this point, platelet-rich plasma has shown the most promising results in aiding the nonoperative treatment. The rehabilitation should be injury tailored and have a progressive increase in intensity, range of motion and eccentric resistance, and end with neuromuscular control and sports specific exercises. In this article, we set to review the current approach to diagnosing and managing a hamstring injury in athletes.

Content: Risk factors for hamstring can be categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Modifiable risk factors include inadequate warm-up, increased training volume, muscle fatigue, hamstring stiffness and inflexibility, and hamstring weakness relative to the quadriceps. Non-modifiable risk factors include previous hamstring or lower limb muscle injury, older age and African or Aboriginal ethnic origin. In athletes, especially soccer and football players, speed and kicking positions also increase the risk of injury. Previous hamstring injury is the most preponderant risk factor and is associated with the highest rate of reinjury, depending on the size and severity of the initial injury. This is thought to be caused by architectural changes in the muscle, where normal muscle tissue is replaced by scar tissue.

Content: Fatigue is regarded as a major risk factor behind most hamstring injuries. 6 10 12 27-30 Most of the risk factors perceived by CMOs (table 2) can be divided into two categories both of which lead to fatigue and consequently an increased risk for hamstring injury: (1) Excessive training/ too many matches/overloading with subsequent accumulation of fatigue and (2) Too little specific training leading to muscle underloading. Dysfunction such as lack of eccentric strength, implies that load tolerance of the hamstrings is not good enough, and this may lead to either fatigue (injuries often appearing late in a match) or muscles not being prepared for match activity (injuries appear early in a match). Figures 1-4 illustrate a theoretical framework for the correlation between fatigue and muscle dysfunction, and risk for hamstring injury. We have previously reported from the ECIS that muscle injuries occur more frequently toward the end of a Figure 1 For a fresh player who begins a game with peak action performance and normal muscle function that corresponds to the loads demanded by the game, the risk for hamstring injury is minimal.

Content: Hamstring injuries have traditionally been classified in 3 grades based on severity: Grade I, Grade II and Grade III. Grade I injuries account for a strain of the muscle fibres. Grade II are partial tears of the muscle and/or tendon, they are presented with pain and noticeable loss of strength. Grade III is a complete tear of the musculotendinous unit with complete loss of function, typically accompanied with pain and a large haematoma. Additionally, for description purposes, injuries can be classified based on their anatomical location - from proximal to distal - as well their degree of avulsion.[1, 9] These scales aren't however widely spread and therefore not very used.

Insufficient rehabilitation (both strength and speed) results in lower load capacity of the muscle and puts it at higher injury risk during high- speed play. 13 Furthermore, residual weakness after a previous injury may lead to muscle imbalance, increasing the risk of fatigue in the weak muscle. 12 Studies suggest a change in neuromuscular control after a hamstring injury with lengthening of the muscle leading to falls in strength and EMG activation. 39 40

Content: Diagnostic imaging in hamstring injuries should start with ultrasonography. It is accessible, inexpensive, innocuous and has great sensitivity towards these injuries during the acute phase, when fluid can be found in the soft tissue. It is however a very operator dependent test and doesn't provide very detailed image, becoming less accurate over time. The gold standard for diagnosing hamstring injuries is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[3, 8] It is crucial when assessing the amount of soft tissue involved as well as the location and extent of the injury, differentiating partial from complete muscle tear, number of tendons involved and amount of retraction. MRI findings are, therefore, very helpful when making the decision of whether to go for a surgical treatment, in addition to being very useful for estimating recovery time by measuring and correlating the length and cross-section area of the injury, as studied by Cohen et al., in a trial conducted with professional football players that suffered acute hamstring injuries. The authors created a predictive MRI scoring table, which included the age of the patient, number of muscles injured, location of injury within the muscle, percentage of muscle involved, extent of retraction and T2 signal length, each parameter scoring up to 3 points (table 1). Patients whose scores were above 15 were found to have a delayed recovery, whereas those with scores below 10 missed none or one game. The longest recoveries were associated with patients with multiple muscle injuries, percentage of muscle involvement greater than 75%, T2 sagittal plane signal longer than 10 cm and over 2 cm of retraction. Orthopaedic injuries tend to be diagnosed with the help of radiographs, but in what regards hamstring injuries, these will only be of diagnostic use in case of an avulsion fracture of the ischial tuberosity.

Content: Most hamstring injuries respond well to conservative management. The main priority of the non-surgical treatment is to control the pain and decrease inflammation caused by the acute injury. There is, however, no full consensus on what the conservative treatment should consist in.[22, 25] The most agreed on and valid treatment is RICE - rest, ice, compression, elevation. It restrains the initial inflammatory response and helps control edema and haemorrhage. Despite that, recent studies have exposed its limitation. One of the main concerns is that a long resting phase longer than 72 hours can lead to a bigger loss of muscle strength and flexibility and can delay the return to normal function. It is thought that an earlier and gradual return to activity is related to a rapid recovery. Consequently, the POLICE protocol - protection, optimal load, ice, compression, elevation - has shown better results. Optimal load means gradually replacing rest with a balanced and incremental amount of physical activity. This also contributes towards better regeneration and orientation of the injured muscle fibres.[27, 28] Protection provided by crutches, braces or other supports is also highly recommended to avoid further injury to the affected site. It is necessary to point out that the non-surgical approach to treating hamstring injuries is dependent on its severity - for example, more extensive injuries to the muscle and soft tissue may experience a longer period of recovery.[8, 24] Considering this high discrepancy, there isn't a fixed time protocol that can be applied, but rather a recovery program tailored to the patient's symptoms and level of pain, to ensure an adequate rehabilitation, focusing on strengthening and regain of function. Returning to activity prematurely may submit patients to a high risk of reinjury.[22, 29]

As the game proceeds fatigue increases with an even greater mismatch between load demanded by the game and the player's performance, and the risk for hamstring injury increases rapidly. physical performance is largely affected by peripheral (muscle) fatigue whereas technical performance more by central (brain and neural) factors. 33 Muscle fatigue can lead to injury situations due to poor control of muscles and joints or overloading/overstretching of muscles. Poor recovery from a previous load may increase the vulnerability of the hamstring muscle fibres to subsequent high intensity loads. Neural fatigue may reduce the player's quality of play. 30 Accuracy is reduced and 'clumsy' play can lead to the player injuring himself or an opponent. 12 27 28 Reactions and speed of play are affected, the player is slower in controlling the ball enabling opponents to get closer leading to contact situations that increase the risk for injury. However, despite common belief and studies indirectly suggesting that fatigue is associated with injury, scientific evidence supporting this theory is weak. 19 In this study, the teams with high hamstring injury rates (the HIGH group) ranked fatigues as a considerably more important risk factor compared with the LOW group with less hamstring injury rates (ranking of importance 3.6 vs 2.6, see table 2).

First, hamstring injury, according to our inclusion criteria, comprises a heterogeneous group including structural (partial or total muscle fibre ruptures) and functional (no macroscopic muscle fibre disruption) injuries, with different foci and severity. Second, there may be different causes for acute or gradual onset hamstring injuries. This was not considered in the present study. The study is also limited by a relatively small sample size and a short observation period. The generalisability of the results from these 15 clubs to other high- level or semiprofessional clubs is unclear.

A better understanding of the importance of communication between medical and coaching staff, as well as improvement in load management and training content during the football season could potentially lead to a fall in the rate of hamstring injuries among professional players. hamstring injury is reported to be the most common recurrent injury in football. 7 Between seasons 2001/2002 and 2013/2014, the rate of match- related hamstring injuries was stable whereas the rate of training- related hamstring injuries increased by an average of 4% each year. 8 During the recent eight seasons (2014/2015-2021/2022), the incidence and burden of hamstring injuries during training and match play have increased significantly, 6 and the proportion of injuries diagnosed as <!-- image --> hamstring injuries increased from 12% in 2001/2002 to 24% in 2021/2022. 6 Various risk factors for hamstring injuries have been proposed, 9-14 and clubs have embraced systematic hamstring prevention programmes to greater or lesser degrees. 15 The aim of this study was to assess the educated opinions and current knowledge on preventable risk factors for hamstring injuries based on information from 15 chief medical officers (CMOs) at European male elite clubs.

Content: Rehabilitation can be divided in three phases. In the first one, the goals are to protect scar development and minimize muscle atrophy. Excessive lengthening of the hamstrings, which would aggravate the initial lesion, should be avoided, and ice should be applied 2 to 3 times a day. Patients should develop the ability to walk and perform daily tasks without pain and perform prone knee flexion with minimal resistance. The second phase focuses on regaining pain-free, mid-range, hamstring strength, while still avoiding end-range lengthening of the muscles. Movement speed should be increased progressively to develop neuromuscular control over the injured limb. Ice should be applied 10 to 15 minutes after exercise. Before passing onto the next phase, patients should be capable of jogging in moderate intensity, as well as performing full strength prone knee flexion without pain. In the third and last phase, the patient's goal is to be symptom-free during all activities. Normal concentric and eccentric hamstring strength through full range of motion and speeds should be achieved. Patients should avoid full intensity exercises if pain, tightness or stiffness are present. Post-exercise ice should be applied only if necessary. To match the criteria for returning to sports, patients should be able to perform full strength activities, have full range of motion and replicate sport specific movements near full speed, without pain.[42, 43] Other options such as ultrasound stimulation, cold and heat compressors, and massaging have been considered as treatments for hamstring injuries, but there are no studies with results to validate them as being better than placebo.[17, 19]

Content: When a player sprints, the activation caused in the hamstrings (level and timing), is very different from the strengthening and prevention exercises typically performed for this muscle group . When we compare the effects of sprinting with the most commonly used exercises for preventing hamstring injuries such as Nordic Hamstring exercises, it Sports 2024 , 12 , x FOR PEER REVIEW becomes evident that sprinting activates the long head of the biceps femoris (BF) more. In particular, research shows that the activation of the BF is higher during sprinting than in Nordic Hamstring exercises . When a player exceeds 80% of his/her maximal sprinting speed (MSS), the activation of the BF is significantly greater than the activation experienced by the rest of the hamstring muscles involved . Specifically, as running speed increased from 80% to 100%, the BFlh activity during the terminal swing phase increased by an average of 67%, while the semitendinosus and the semimembranosus only showed a 37% increase . According to previous studies, the higher activation of the BF muscle could be a result of attempting to slow down the forward movement of the limb . This phenomenon could also explain why the BF muscle is often injured during high-speed activities . According to some authors, activating this muscle group reaching speeds higher than 90% MSS during training results in a lower risk of injury . Only if the quality and technique of the movement are adequate , specific programming of high-speed training would have a protective effect as a 'vaccine' against HSIs . For example, it has recently been shown that an increase in anterior pelvic tilt results in a significant nonuniform increase in tissue elongation in all regions of the three hamstring muscles (greater in the proximal than in the distal region); hence, if we want to prevent injuries, we must know the impact of this when we demand high-speed efforts from the athlete .

Content: Neuromuscular Factors Hamstring/quadriceps strength ratio imbalance is a key risk factor for hamstring muscle injury; specifically, decreased hamstring strength relative to quadriceps strength is a risk factor for knee ligamentous injuries in both male and female youth soccer players [29, 42]. Decreased single leg hop distance is also associated with increased hamstring injury risk . While current evidence is inconclusive for muscle strength asymmetry (i.e., right vs. left) as a risk factor, eccentric hamstring strength asymmetry is specifically indicated as a key predictor of injury among male youth soccer players . Furthermore, eccentric hamstring strength (&lt; 256 N) and single leg hamstring bridge scores of less than 20 reps on the right leg are associated with increased risk of hamstring strain . Poor landing mechanics, specifically, increased dynamic knee valgus, is associated with increased risk for lower limb injury, including ACL injury [9, 42, 43]. Leg dominance and leg asymmetry also relates to increased risk of injury; a difference of 15% or greater, between an individual ' s dominant and nondominant limb, has been shown to predict future injury . An asymmetry of greater than 4 cm on the anterior reach portion of the Y-balance test places athletes at 2.5 times greater risk for injury among male youth soccer players [42, 43]. Hip external rotation strength scores using handheld dynamometry of less than 18% of the individual ' s body weight is associated with lower extremity and back injuries . Additionally, the literature suggests that the risk of injury may increase with altered neuromuscular firing during dynamic movements like cutting or landing, and dynamic stability deficits may increase lower extremity injury risk for male youth soccer players .

Content: Depending on the specific context of each sport, the objective of the athlete when performing a sprint is to cover a certain distance in the shortest possible time . During a soccer game, a player covers an average of 17 to 81 sprints, with 2 to 4 s duration, and usually over distances of less than 20 m . Approximately 70% of all these actions appear when the player is already moving and not when they are standing in a position . Thus, the inclusion of training sprints in soccer must consider that these actions are mainly 'flying sprints', with a curvilinear rather than a linear trajectory . All these high-speed efforts have increased in recent years in professional soccer . In most cases, goals and decisive actions are preceded by such efforts . Soccer players must be physically well prepared to deal with these demands . A greater adaptation to sport demands and the use of multifactorial prevention protocols could be the explanation for the apparent general reduction in injuries .

Runner's Knee can come as a result of increasing your mileage too quickly; try going back to your 1-2 minute run 1-2 minute walk because your body might not be ready for much more than that (yet). - Ice your knee and take anti-inflammatory drugs (ex. ibuprofen) whenever you exerpience knee pain. With regard to the shin pain, this is almost certainly shin splints ( ). The shin splints most likely came about because you increased your mileage too quickly, and as a result your muscles weren't strong enough to absorb the stress from running while fatigued. The same remedies for Runners Knee apply here, so make sure you stretch, workout the whole leg, have proper footware, and so on. see wikipedia article <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 3 <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 2 <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> 1

Content: According to certain authors, the protective effect of running may be associated with leg stiffness (K leg ) . Kleg has been proposed to be of substantial importance during sprinting, because it generates an increase in ground reaction forces that facilitate the storage and return of elastic energy, thus increasing the stride frequency and reducing ground contact time . Lower Kleg has been linked to inefficient storage and, in running kinematics and movement efficiency, is associated with an increased load on the contractile muscle units, which, in theory, also increases the risk of HSIs . The number of factors influencing mechanical stiffness during running (age, running technique, sporting background, fatigue, running distance, etc.) makes it difficult to formulate clear and general conclusions about training recommendations . Nevertheless, it remains evident that in order to attain optimal stiffness, this 'vaccine' must be tailored to the soccer context and adapted to the specific capabilities and running mechanics of the player . Otherwise, positive and protective adaptations will not be elicited. In addition, it should be noted that the relationship between sprint training and injury appearance is U-shaped, thus an inappropriate dose, insufficient or excessive, could increase the risk of injury significantly as well (Figure 1).

Content: The surgical treatment has three major indications (table 3). Two of those are in acute circumstances: when complete ruptures of the hamstrings occur too proximally; or when two or more muscles are avulsed from their origin at the ischial tuberosity, with a retraction of 2 cm or greater.[8, 18, 44] Studies have reported that the non-operative treatment of these injuries is associated to a longer period of recovery with worse results, particularly noticeable during heavy activity. Patients who undergo surgical repair during the acute phase tend to be significantly more satisfied with the end results, having more efficient pain relief, better strength and endurance, and a quicker return to preinjury level of sport than patients who opt for nonoperative treatment. Therefore, surgical treatment for acute complete proximal hamstring ruptures is highly recommended in elite athletes. A study has shown that athletically active patients who underwent surgery were able to return to sport in an average of 6 months. Finally, when avulsion occurs with hamstring retraction, delaying the surgical treatment can lead to a more technically challenging surgery and could increase the occurrence of sciatic nerve symptoms. The chronic indication for surgery is hamstring syndrome. Patients who suffer from this syndrome have a history of chronic hamstring injuries, causing scarring of the tissues, which can compress the sciatic nerve upon muscle contraction. Therefore, patients often report pain in the area bound to the ischial tuberosity, irradiating distally to the thigh - sciatic nerve symptoms. A study performed by Young and van Riet included 43 patients who underwent a surgical release for this diagnosis with very positive outcomes. Patients who undergo the surgical treatment should then follow a very similar rehabilitation plan to the one listed for the conservative treatment (table 2).[22, 44]

Lateral ankle sprains occur when the ankle is plantarflexed and inverted and can happen when a player is cutting, changing speed or direction, or landing from a jump. Soccer players typically have tight calves, which may predispose them to lateral ankle sprains due to the relative position of plantar flexion caused by calf tightness.

Content: Objectives To describe the perceived importance of suggested hamstring injury risk factors according to chief medical officers (CMOs) of European male professional football clubs. A secondary objective was to compare if these perceptions differed between teams with a lowerthan- average hamstring injury burden and teams with a higher than average hamstring injury burden. Methods First, CMOs of 15 European professional male football clubs were asked to suggest risk factors for hamstring injury in their club. The perceived importance of the suggested risk factors was then rated by all participants on a 5- graded Likert scale. Participating teams were divided in two groups depending on their hamstring injury burden during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons. The LOW group consisted of seven teams that had a lower than average hamstring injury burden. The HIGH group consisted of eight teams that had a higherthan- average hamstring injury burden. Results Twenty- one risk factors were suggested. The majority were extrinsic in nature, associated with coaching staff, team or club rather than players themselves. 'Lack of communication between medical staff and coaching staff' had the highest average importance (weighted average=3.7) followed by 'Lack of regular exposure to high- speed football during training sessions' (weighted average=3.6). The HIGH group perceived the player factors fatigue and wellness as more important than the LOW group. Conclusion According to CMOs recruited in this study, most risk factors for hamstring injuries are extrinsic and associated with the club and coaching staff, and not the players themselves.

Content: The gold standard for the hamstrings is the Nordic Hamstring Exercise. Incorporating hamstring eccentric strengthening exercises has been found to be successful in helping to reduce the incidence of hamstring strain injuries up to 51% in soccer players (8). Eccentric exercises increase muscle fascicle length and improve eccentric strength, thereby addressing two of the modifiable risk factors associated with hamstring strain injuries. A comprehensive hamstring strain injury prevention program should include eccentric hamstring strengthening exercises, quad and hamstring flexibility, neuromuscular control of the lower extremities and lumbopelvic region, core stability, and sportspecific movement patterns.

Despite athletes being studied as much as lab mice, this warning sign - which would have immense value to the elite sports industry, if confirmed - has barely been touched by researchers. But it has been touched now, by Whalan et al . They studied a bunch of soccer players to show that minor physical complaints - 'niggles' - are probably clear warning signs of more serious athletic injuries. 16 How clear? The complaints were linked to at least triple the risk of a more serious injury in the next week. Triple! Speaking for myself... I am getting old enough now that I haven't gone a day without a niggle, let alone a week, since about 2015. If I stopped for every niggle, I'd never do anything active at all!

Muscle strains are the most frequent type of injury, representing 51.4% of cases. Smashes and lunges are often implicated in injuries to both upper and lower extremities. Notably, elite athletes report that a majority of injuries occur during the first third of the game (46.2%) . Recent studies corroborate that injuries are most likely to happen in the early phases of a match and detail the specific injury sites in elite athletes. However, the mechanisms and specific injury sites in badminton's general player population remain poorly understood. Consequently, further experimental and observational studies are essential to explore injury patterns and improve diagnosis in this demographic. Such research is crucial to assist the public in safely engaging with badminton and in preventing chronic injuries.

Content: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are generally recommended and should be prescribed to reduce inflammation and pain perception in the earlier stages of the injury. It is effective at managing pain in most injuries and has shown to reduce inflammatory reactions with no harm to tissue healing in that period. For long-term use, however, it is thought that NSAID usage can delay muscle regeneration.[22, 30] Corticosteroid intramuscular injections in hamstring injuries hasn't been widely studied and there is lack of strong evidence supporting this treatment. Despite that, Levine et al. performed a study on football players with grade II hamstring injuries, over the course of 13 years. Players were capable of returning to a preinjury level of competition in a mean of 7.6 days, while reporting no side effects or negative outcomes. Although there were no controls on this study, it has shown a very promising outlook for the role of corticosteroids. Other studies have exposed, however, both favourable and unfavourable effects on the recovery of the injured muscles so this method remains controversial, since there are potential side effects of injecting corticosteroids into injured muscles.[32, 33] Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is currently being investigated for its effectiveness in speeding the healing of hamstring injuries. To produce PRP, a double spin of the patient's whole blood is required, but despite its increase in popularity, clinical evidence to define the preferred method regarding the injectable volume, timing of the application and number of injections is lacking.[33, 35] The argument for the use of PRP relies on the theory that growth factors and cytokines released by the platelets would enhance the natural recovery process. PRP also has an established painrelieving effect provided.

Content: There is still some controversy regarding the treatment and rehabilitation protocols for hamstring injuries in athletes, but some general principles can aid the orthopaedic surgeon in the decision-making process. Most injuries are managed conservatively with good and excellent results. Currently, PRP shows the most promising results in aiding non-operative treatment. Complete injury of all three hamstrings and proximal avulsions with 2 cm of retraction have the strongest surgical indication. The main goals of the rehabilitation protocol are to return the athlete to activity at a pre-injury level of performance and to minimize risk of reinjury, focusing on eccentric and proprioceptive exercises. Each individual should have an injury tailored rehabilitation plan. Further studies will help to define and optimize a protocol for the treatment and rehabilitation of these lesions.

Most injuries (60 -90%) occur in the lower limbs, especially the ankle, knee (anterior cruciate ligament), and thigh (quadriceps and hamstrings). These are non-contact injuries [5, 10] that occur without impact in players , and include sprains, strains, and contusions that mainly affect the thigh and calf muscles and ankle and knee joints [10, 12]. These are mainly attributed to inappropriate warm-up, muscle fatigue, and muscle imbalance . Soccer-related injuries are associated with both nonmodifiable factors, such as sex and age, and modifiable factors, such as those that can be improved through programs that influence force, balance, and flexibility. Although both sets of factors interact and are risk determinants [13 -15], professional players stop participating in soccer because of many modifiable causes . The evaluation and implementation of preventive soccer training routines are essential, as injuries are associated with expensive treatment and prolonged withdrawal duration [5, 16].

Content: - Runner's knee : Patellofemoral pain syndrome, commonly known as runner's knee, causes pain just behind or next to the kneecap. Discomfort often begins as mild pain that can worsen over time, especially when you put pressure on your knee. - Iliotibial band syndrome: The iliotibial band, or IT band, is a long piece of tissue that connects your outer hip to your knee. IT band syndrome happens when the IT band repetitively rubs against the leg bone, causing sharp pain on the outer part of your leg just above the knee. - Shin splints: Also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, shin splints cause pain along the shinbones in your lower legs. This injury frequently occurs when you increase your running volume too quickly. - Plantar fasciitis : The bottom of your foot contains a thick layer of tissue called fascia, which acts as a spring when you walk or run. Over time, intense running can lead to pain in your heel and the middle of your foot that can worsen after prolonged activity. - Stress fractures: Repetitive stress can cause hairline cracks to form in bones. Runners often get stress fractures in the heel, lower leg or top of the foot. - Achilles tendinitis: When your Achilles tendon, which connects your calf muscle to your heel, becomes inflamed, it can cause pain and swelling in your lower leg. - Ankle sprains: A sprain can result when you overstretch the muscle between your ankle and leg, which often happens by landing on the outside of your foot.

Conversely, don't overdo it. I've seen sports teams scrimmage for an hour before game time. I think that's crazy: players go into competition not only warmed up but worn out.

This includes manual therapy, strengthening and flexibility exercises, and the use of rehabilitation technologies such as biofeedback and laser therapy. Player Education: Educating players on the importance of following rehabilitation protocols, early recognition of injury symptoms, and injury prevention strategies is key to ensuring quick and effective recovery and preventing re-injury. Personalising Rehabilitation Protocols: Recognising that every athlete and injury is unique, it is crucial to tailor the rehabilitation programme to each individual's specific needs, including considering the type of injury, severity, and sporting goals of the player.

There is extensive high-quality evidence (including two reviews of systematic reviews) showing the clinical effectiveness of exercise-based interventions in the form of neuromuscular training (NMT) warm-up programs in reducing all soccer-related injuries across sex, ages, and skill levels. Specifically, the 11+ (formerly called the FIFA 11+) warm-up program reduces overall injury rate (i.e., all injuries) by 30 to 47% [23, 44 -46], lower limb injury rate by 39 to 44% [44, 45], overuse injury rate by 55%, and knee injury rate by 52% . Emerging evidence also suggests that the 11+ Kids (a version for children under 12 years old) is efficacious (48% reduction for all injuries) for reducing injuries in younger players . Additionally, the ' Knee Injury Prevention Program ' (KIPP) has the potential to significantly reduce non-contact lower limb injury and overuse injury among young female soccer players by 50% and 56%, respectively . In a recent systematic review, the application of a variety of exercise-based injury prevention programs for youth players was found to reduce injury rates by up to 46% . Furthermore, the risk of hamstring injuries can be reduced by up to 51% when the Nordic Hamstring exercise is implemented in isolation . A recent meta-analysis showed that ankle injuries can be reduced by as much as 40% and a meta-analysis of meta-analyses demonstrated that a 50% reduction can be achieved for all ACL injuries in a heterogeneous sample of athletes, including soccer players, when NMT warm-up is implemented.

Content: Several authors have discussed possibilities for prevention of a soccer injury such as: - warm-up with more emphasis on stretching; - regular cool-down; - adequate rehabilitation with sufficient recovery time; - proprioceptive training; - protective equipment; - good playing field conditions; - adherence to the existing rules. These topics are closely related to the 10-point action plan to avoid sports injury proposed by the Sport Smart programme of the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation (table II). Preventive programmes generally focus either on the reduction of all injuries associated with a given sport or on a particular type of injury that is extremely severe or frequent. With respect to soccer, three studies have focused on the prevention of injuries in general and seven others have evaluated the prevention of specific types of injury, namely ankle sprains, severe injuries of the knee and hamstring strains (table III).

Content: strong and coordinated muscle activation across the hip, knee, and ankle joints stabilizes these areas and absorbs impact forces effectively. Finally, balanced force distribution across the lower limb joints prevents overloading any single joint, thereby reducing the risk of overuse injuries. It is also important to avoid landing with a heel-strike position, excessive ankle inversion, greater knee dynamic abduction, inadequate hip flexion angle, higher external hip rotation strength, and insufficient hip abduction strength to further reduce injury risks . Prevention training programs, therefore, should focus on hip abductor strength, core stability, knee stability, and proper ankle positioning during landing to reduce injury risks. Additionally, neuromuscular activities such as warm-up exercises, plyometrics, and balance training have proven effective in reducing lower extremity injuries. Warm-up exercises have been shown to reduce perceived muscle soreness after exercise and prevent exercise-related injuries [51, 53]. Integrating both static and dynamic stretching can improve flexibility, reduce muscle stiffness, and lower the risk of acute muscle injuries . In contrast, active cool down does not appear to diminish the long-term adaptive response or prevent injury . Our findings show that only one-third of the participants always warmed up before playing badminton, which may explain the high incidence of injuries observed. Emphasizing the importance of warm-ups is crucial for senior players. Sport-specific plyometric exercises not only improve change-of-direction speed, enhance agility, muscle strength, and overall performance but also play a crucial role in injury prevention [55, 56]. Proprioceptive training programs significantly enhance neuromuscular control and joint stability, effectively reducing the incidence of ankle injuries

Content: The next part of this routine will focus on core and pelvic stability. Core stability training may help players to remain injury-free in an indirect way, as a strong core minimizes joint loads in all types of activities &amp; movements (Hibbs et al., 2008), not to mention the assistance it offers them to deal with the physical contact that football requires (i.e. duels, 1v1 movements, physical contact). (https://www.isspf.com/) In addition, a strong and stable core is crucial in providing a foundation for the movement of the upper and lower extremities to support loads and to protect the spinal cord and nerve signals (Wilson et al., 2005). During this stage we also enable single leg balance exercises known as proprioception training. Balance training or proprioceptive exercises are considered to be an effective strategy when the aim is to reduce ankle or such like knee or joint sprains of lower extremities. Balance exercises can be a really good way to reduce joint injuries as long as core strength and stability are combined. This improvement results in fewer subsequent energy leakage and improved force transmission (Wilson et al., 2005). <!-- image --> <!-- image --> <!-- image --> Muscle activation routines are most of the time focussed around engagement of neural stimulation in order to activate the muscles directly used during training sessions or competitive games. (https://www.isspf.com/) According to scientific literature it has been suggested that these routines aim to increase joint stability, improve the ability to generate optimal muscle firing patterns and finally to improve postural control through stabilising side-to-side imbalances in the lower body extremities (Caraffa et al., 1996; Soderman et al., 2000; Heitkamp et al., 2001).

The program comprises a complete warm-up procedure aimed at injury prevention in soccer players. It includes 15 structured exercises, is available as printed material or online, and is easily executed . The exercises consist of core stabilization, eccentric thigh muscle training, proprioceptive training, dynamic stabilization, and plyometric exercises, all performed with proper postural alignment. Program effectiveness was confirmed by various studies involving female and male players that revealed significant decreases in the incidence of non-contact injuries. The program was initially designed for amateur soccer; however, several studies demonstrated its effectiveness for other sports such as basketball . The program is composed of 3 stages, with 15 exercises following a specific sequence. It is essential that the correct techniques are used, with emphasis on appropriate posture and body control, including leg alignment, knee positioning over the foot tip, and smooth landings (Table 1) .

The international literature search yielded 11 studies that were included in the review as they met the criteria set. These studies investigated either the effectiveness of neuromuscular training as a warm-up versus a conventional warm-up program , or the effectiveness of neuromuscular training at different dosages that differed in the frequency of use of the program or its duration , while a study was found that investigated the effectiveness of the program depending on the level of education of the coaches . FIFA 11+ is the most common neuromuscular training program in use today. The program consists of three stages and fifteen exercises that are performed in a particular order . Comparing the effectiveness of the application of this program against the conventional warm-up program, it was observed that in all cases the rate of lower limb injuries significantly decreased , showing that this is an effective intervention.

Overall, the execution of NMT warm-up programs when implemented ranged between low and moderate [60, 68]. To improve the spread and implementation of evidencebased injury prevention intervention in soccer, an understanding of implementation contexts is imperative.

As previously mentioned, the FIFA 11+ program is easily applicable; however, effectiveness is only obtained if exercises are performed within the existing standards. On the other hand, homogeneity in program application was absent among different reference groups, which affected the results obtained through the combined analysis. A standard protocol for the warm-up program application was nonexistent; thus, application in some studies was according to FIFA recommendations, i.e., 2 or 3 times a week [25, 26], while others used 1-week intervals [23, 24, 27, 28]. Furthermore, differences were observed in the study period duration, which varied between 4.5 and 9 months. All these factors may have affected the results, which may be more reliable in the groups that applied the program using the recommended frequency; weekly evaluations may not have revealed the true program effectiveness. Therefore, it is important to consider that the effectiveness of warm-up programs depends on long-term factors such as the development of muscular strength for protecting, supporting, and stabilizing skeletal articulations . Thus, studies with shorter durations may not have allowed sufficient time for the development of appropriate muscular strength. The minimum duration that is necessary according to the program recommendation is 10 -12 weeks, if applied using the appropriate frequency .

You may choose to start running to improve your figure, lose weight, increase cardiovascular fitness, or socialize with friends. Whatever the reason, it's a good idea to identify this goal when creating your exercise program. If you want to improve cardiovascular fitness, for instance, you should run at a quick pace to maximize your heart rate. If you're running to lose weight or reduce body fat, it's better to run at a slower rate for a longer time. Depending on your goal, your healthcare provider or personal trainer may decide that a modest walking or jogging program is appropriate. Setting goals helps you follow a safe pace and keeps you from overexertion, which can result in injury. - Have a physical evaluation. Certain health problems may hamper your running performance and increase your risk for injury. Specifically, osteoporosis, arthritis, and other degenerative joint diseases can increase your injury risk.If you have any significant health issues, youshould discuss these with your healthcare provider before you start to run. - Warm up before you run and stretch after you run. Doing so can prevent some of the most common injuries. It's most important to stretch muscles that moveyour leg and anklejoints. These include the calf muscle, which moves the knee and ankle, and the hamstring, which moves the knee and hip. Walk or gently jog for5 minutes. Cool down at the same pace for another 5 minutes at the end of your run. - Wear the correct shoes. Buyrunningshoes at an athletic store, where a salesclerk can help you choose a shoe that fits your foot type. This can help prevent injuries.

It is important for coaches, parents, and administrators to be aware of concussion signs and symptoms and know what to do if concussion is suspected. For concussion prevention, there is evidence that education about concussion among key stakeholders, e.g., coaches, referees, and parents, can reduce the incidence of concussion and facilitate improved outcomes . Interventions for primary (e.g., rule change and avoiding a slippery playing surface) and secondary (e.g., concussion recognition and decision on return to playtime) prevention are mainly informational for coaches and parents/guardians.

Content: The growing concern regarding injury prevalence in soccer has prompted extensive research into preventive measures. Among the proposed strategies, neuromuscular training has gained significant attention due to its potential to enhance motor control, proprioception, and muscular strength, all of which contribute to injury mitigation . Neuromuscular training encompasses various forms of intervention aimed at enhancing motor control, strength, balance, and movement efficiency to reduce injury risk. These programs can include balance training, plyometric exercises, strength conditioning, and proprioceptive drills. While some interventions focus on sport-specific movements, others emphasize general neuromuscular activation to improve overall stability and coordination. Neuromuscular training programs, such as the FIFA 11+, have been specifically designed to reduce lower limb injury incidence by integrating exercises that focus on dynamic stability, strength, and coordination . Studies have demonstrated that teams implementing the FIFA 11+ experience a substantial decline in injury rates compared to those following conventional warm-up routines . However, despite these promising findings, inconsistencies in adherence and variations in program execution have raised concerns about its practical effectiveness across different age groups, sexes, and competitive levels .

Content: Acomment that should, however, be highlighted is that of the studies comparing FIFA 11+ program with a conventional warm-up program, only one included women , while the rest exclusively included males . Although Soligard et al. found a decrease in the frequency of injuries among women as well, there is a clear lack of data on the effectiveness of the program in women . Regarding the other neuromuscular training programs studied, Emery and Meeuwisse and Aman et al. included both men and women, while Walden et al. and Finch et al. only included men . Interestingly, Aman et al., who compared the effectiveness of the program between the two sexes, observed that in women, the program resulted in a more notable decrease in the number of injuries, with cruciate ligament injuries being reduced by 6% in men and 13% in women, while knee injuries were reduced by 8% in men and 21% in women . The fact that injuries occur more frequently in female athletes than in male competitors may help to explain this, leading the injury prevention program to be more important for this population and presenting a greater efficiency . Although neuromuscular training appears to be successful in protecting soccer athletes from injury, the question remains whether the dosage of the program can affect its effectiveness. Silvers-Granelli et al. compared the incidence of injuries between groups, showing the different adherence rates to the program . They observed that adherence to the program showed a statistically significant negative correlation to the frequency of injuries and also to the days lost due to them. This shows that the more this program is used, the more its effectiveness increases.

It is easy to see why preventing an ACL injury in the first place is a high priority. The intrinsic modifiable risk factors associated with an ACL tear are BMI, neuromuscular and biomechanical deficits, hormonal status, and fatigue. There are several ACL injury prevention/prehab programs out there, but the successful ones have some common elements: running warm-up, dynamic stretching, plyometrics, lower extremity strengthening, core control, and dynamic balance with an emphasis on correct mechanics. The best results have been demonstrated when the prevention program is implemented during pre-season and maintained throughout the season .

Content: Given these risk factors, structured injury prevention approaches are essential. Individualized training load management can mitigate cumulative stress, while stroke technique optimization may reduce joint strain. Targeted strength programs focusing on the shoulder, knee, and lumbar spine can enhance stability, and structured recovery protocols, including periodized rest and mobility exercises, may help to counteract fatigue and repetitive stress effects. To specifically address the FAT, training programs should integrate nutritional strategies to ensure adequate energy availability, menstrual health monitoring, and bone health assessments. Female swimmers at risk of FAT may benefit from adjusting their training loads during periods of low energy availability and implementing strength-based interventions to enhance bone mineral density and joint stability. Additionally, educational programs for athletes and coaches on the early detection of FAT symptoms could help to prevent long-term health consequences.

Content: The literature presents a few studies that suggest the ineffectiveness of the use of the FIFA 11+ program in decreasing the injury rate, which highlights the need for an improved understanding of this subject.

A thorough reference analysis attributed the heterogeneity to clinical factors inherent to the sample, such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and clinical characteristics of the injuries.

Content: Adopting a causal framework can greatly inform injury prevention and treatment efforts by tailoring a program to the runner's risk profile and recent training loads. Enhancing pre-run load capacity of the athlete via consistent, progressive loading (progressive strengthening, minimizing training spikes), addressing psychological stressors, and optimizing a runner's physiology is the first step. Second, considering the attributes of the individual runner (i.e., masters male vs adolescent female) and the ability of the athlete's physiology to support tissue remodeling will help inform physiological interventions and training load pre- scription. Tailoring training load prescription to address structure-specific cumulative microdamage should also be specific to past injuries or anatomical structures that are more likely to experience injury in specific sub-populations. For example, those recovering from, or at-risk for, Achilles tendinopathy should add speedwork into a training program judiciously, whereas downhill running should be added in slowly if recovering from, or at-risk for, patellofemoral pain. Wearable technologies can monitor injury-specific training loads (i.e., number of steps) while performing activities known to increase loading on injury-susceptible tissues, helping inform the need for recovery days <!-- image --> to restore pre-run load capacity and support tissue adaptation. Lastly, clinicians should adopt routine screening for RED-S and other physiological conditions known to reduce tissue adaptability and refer out for specialized care when indicated. We believe that by employing a causal framework of running injury aetiology that considers current theory in tissue mechanics and physiology, and by following general principles of injury risk management, the puzzle of running injury prevention and treatment has potential to be solved.

Content: This point is underlined by the high proportion of overuse injuries, which require a systematic injury prevention programme that considers mobilisation, strength training and other aspects of the treatment and prevention of overuse injuries. 42 44 It, therefore, seems useful for coaches to record the acute training load to get an idea of whether the training volume, frequency or intensity needs to be reduced. On the one hand, excessive and rapid increases in training loads account for many injuries. 45 Piggott and Newton 46 showed that 40% of injuries were associated with a rapid change (&gt;10%) in the weekly training load in the preceding week. On the other hand, evidence suggests that appropriate physical training benefits by developing physical qualities that protect against injury. 45 It has been shown that a greater amount of short, high- intensity acceleration training and game- specific aerobic activities can equip athletes with the appropriate physical qualities to perform at a high level and protect against injury. 45

Content: here, the following risk factors can only be cautiously emphasised: The risk of injury appears to increase as the level of play rises, and a history of injury also appears to be associated with an increased risk of reinjury. This finding is based on the results of Jrgensen and Winge, 36 who explicitly found a higher proportion of overuse injuries in elite players, as well as the fact that the injury rates in the five studies that only examined the level of elite players were generally at the upper end of the incidence rates. Three publications 16 23 28 specifically show an increased injury rate after an injury to either the same site or a different body site related to the original injury. Furthermore, the lower extremities are particularly affected, and overuse injuries appear to be a relevant problem. Coaches and medical staff should be aware of these risk factors and pay particular attention to young professional athletes with a history of injury. Especially during athletic development, young players move to high- competition classes and promptly increase their training workload. The association between the occurrence of injuries and training load has been observed in numerous studies. 42 It is, therefore, often important to ensure that the total load of young players is adapted to their training history to counteract the problem of too much progress being desired in too short a time without the body being prepared for the increased demands. This means that adapting to the progression of intensity, duration and frequency of training to the individual's performance and fatigue level is of crucial importance. 43

Content: Another approach to monitoring the load would be regularly completing a questionnaire, such as the 'Short Recovery and Stress Scale'. 47 48 This instrument assesses the emotional, physiological, mental and overall aspects of recovery and stress. 48 This is also important in the offtraining lives of young people with a lot of potential stress in their private lives and at school. Although the degree of physical maturity is not explicitly addressed in any of these studies, particular attention should be paid to this due to the 'injury age' of under 20 years emphasised in some studies. Adolescence is a time of physical, psychosocial and cognitive development and physical and psychological instability in which hormonal, musculoskeletal and neurocognitive changes of adolescence drive factors for sports- related injuries. 49 Changes in the muscle skeleton and subsequent physiological characteristics affect the increased risk of sports- related injuries. 49 Training methods adapted to the development stage could help reduce injuries and growth- related overload conditions. 50 Repetitive mechanical loads that require rapid deceleration and a quick change of direction should be reduced in favour of more technically oriented movement exercises. 51 Injury history is also a major risk factor for future (re) injury to the body region in question. 52 53 This may be due to residual deficits in the previously injured joint or muscle, such as proprioceptive deficits, altered muscular recruitment patterns or altered biomechanics, 54 which make the athlete more susceptible to reinjury. 53 There is a strong positive correlation between the exposure time and the total number of injuries. 55 This results in a direct relation between an athlete's past career time and an existing injury history. For this reason, an injury history often affects older players, for whom a balanced and individualised training plan is very important.

Content: As a team-based sport, the training and competition loads of soccer are uniformly arranged, but the application of the same load will have different effects on the modifiable risk factors of players with different fitness levels, and will then produce different degrees of injury risk. This is also confirmed by the results of a series of studies related to soccer injuries. Players with increased intermittent aerobic capacity were better able to tolerate increased absolute changes in training load than players with lower fitness levels . Improvements in VO2max during the pre-season training period were significantly lower among injured players (0.9 5.5%) compared to non-injured players (10.4 6.5%, p &lt; 0.05) , and well-developed lower-body strength, repeated-sprint ability, and speed were associated with better tolerance to higher workloads and reduced risk of injury in team-sport athletes . When a player does not perform well in a physical fitness test during the pre-season, their training load should be lowered slightly and an individual program should be provided to improve their fitness level. When a player has good fitness test scores and no history of injury, their training load should be moderate to high in order to improve their technical and tactical capability without reducing their physical fitness.

Content: Over the past 10 years, GPS and accelerometer technologies have become the main external load-monitoring tools for team sports, and can objectively and accurately quantify the distance and speed of training and competition, providing a basis for researchers to explore the relationship between GPS variables and injury risk. Training and match exposure provide only rough statistics regarding external load, while load variables such as running distance, speed, change of direction, and acceleration are more explanatory in relation to the risk of injury to athletes . As can be seen in Table 3, the total distance, high-speed running distance, sprint distance, number of accelerations and decelerations in GPS variables, and the weekly cumulative load and ACWR are all used to discuss the relationship between external load and injury risk. The higher the weekly cumulative load at the total distance, the higher the risk of overuse injury . Compared with 0.88-1.11, the overuse injury ratio was higher when the ACWR(1:4) of the total distance was &lt;0.88 and &gt;1.11 . Similarly, a comparison of the total distance between injured and uninjured players revealed that the risk of contact injury was highest at an ACWR (1:4) = 1.76, and a gradual increase in chronic load established a tolerance to high acute loads . In addition, a significant increase in the intensity of training and competition led to an increased risk of injury. Players' relative distances were 9.6% and 7.4% higher than the season average in the first week and the first four weeks before injury, respectively.

Content: For the number of accelerations in training, the greatest risk of contact injury occurs when there is an ACWR (1:4) &gt; 2 and a chronic load &lt; 1731 and an ACWR (1:4) of 1.77 leads to the greatest risk of contact injury . At low 4-week loads, an ACWR &gt; 2 leads to a 5- to 6-fold higher risk of non-contact injury than an ACWR &lt; 2 . These two studies reflect that a rapid increase in the number of accelerations under acute loads leads to an increased risk of injury, especially in the case of low chronic loads. In addition, the 3-week cumulative load (&gt;9254 times) was most correlated with the overall risk of injury and the risk of non-contact injury . Only one study had explored the relationship between deceleration and overuse injury risk, the study showed that an increased injury risk for higher 2- to 4-week loads, and a lower injury risk was found for a medium ACWR = 0.86-1.12 than ACWR &lt; 0.86 and ACWR &gt; 1.12 . In summary, the total distance, high-speed running distance, and number of accelerations all increased the risk of injury at high ACWRs and high weekly cumulative loads, but it is not possible to draw accurate conclusions about their relationship with injury risk. On the one hand, there are few studies on the application of GPS to explore injury risk in elite athletes, so it is difficult to compare the results. On the other hand, there are differences in injury definitions and types, statistical analysis methods, speed threshold settings, and GPS devices (manufacturer, specification, and sampling frequency) among different studies. During training, there should be a focus on monitoring the total distance, high-speed running distance, and acceleration frequency of athletes, and a large amount of the load should be maintained in the form of medium-to-large long-term loads when arranging training and match loads, while avoiding a rapid increase in acute loads.

Content: In our case, being aware that the sprint can have risky and adverse e ff ects if we measure retrospectively, we must try to know why it happened and how this information can serve us in the future . In our case, being aware that the sprint can have risky and adverse effects if we do not use it in its proper measure, we usually quantify our sprint values ' in real time ' using the antennas that most GPS companies provide us, especially during MD-3 (endurance work in large spaces) and MD-2 (speed) training, as they are the ones in which the sprint can appear more frequently. In this manner, we can meticulously adjust the load during the training session. At the same time, we can adapt the individual dose of players according to their weekly needs. Keep in mind that if you do not make certain adjustments during the session, it is likely that you will not be able to apply them in subsequent training. The assessment of the isometric strength of the posterior chain as a marker of neuromuscular fatigue is another strategy that can help us when adjusting the load of each player. A loss of strength or increased asymmetry between both legs are markers of acute fatigue that may be related to the risk of suffering HSIs . For this reason, measuring this level of strength in the posterior chain could inform us of a previous load that is poorly tolerated by the athlete, in order to adjust their future load . The Mc Call supine test, in its two variants (90 and 30 ) , together with a more specific standing modification (IPF 90 -20 ) , is one of the most interesting assessments in this sense. In addition to this isometric component, it could be useful to measure the eccentric response of the hamstrings with devices such as Nordbord (Vald Performance, Australia) , or the explosive component of the posterior chain with the recently proposed ' Ballistic Hip Thrust T est ' .

Content: With the development of commercialization and professionalism in soccer, the professional leagues in many countries have long seasons, many games, and congested schedules ; further, the game is characterized by a long net time, a fast pace of attack and defense, and intense physical confrontation . All of these factors seem to lead to a high incidence of match injuries among professional players. In order to reduce the risk of injuries in matches and meet the diverse demands of the match, players need to undergo systematic, reasonable physical and tactical training to produce positive physiological adaptations . An insufficient training load does not induce functional adaptation in athletes, and an excessive training load may lead to an increased risk of injury , which can affect athletes' competitive performance and team performance . A meta-analysis of the risk of injury in professional male soccer players showed that the overall incidence of injuries was 8.1 injuries/1000 h of exposure, the incidence of match injuries was 36 injuries/1000 h of exposure and the incidence of training injuries was 3.7 injuries/1000 h of exposure . Although sports injuries are caused by the interaction of multiple risk factors, an unreasonable training and competition load is an important external risk factor that can directly or indirectly affect other risk factors . Advantageously, workload can be monitored and manipulated with potential value for injury prevention, compared to non-variable risk factors such as age, sex, and venue.

Similarly, soccer training and sports medicine researchers have applied a variety of methods to monitor the training and competition loads of professional players for one or more seasons, laying a foundation for the in-depth exploration of the relationship between workload and injury risk . In this scenario, the approach to these relationships has changed, with greater individualization of training for pain management, physical therapy, and rehabilitation, tailored to the athlete . Exploring the right balance between training, playing, and recovery is, therefore, one of the biggest challenges faced by soccer practitioners.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/ 4.0/). of players' training load has been proposed . Various methods have been developed to measure/estimate the external or internal load (heart rate monitoring (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and running distances covered at different speeds: total distance (TD), low-speed distance (LSD), high-speed distance, (HSD), sprint distance (SD), accelerations (ACC), and decelerations (DEC)) . Load is categorized into internal and external loads. External load can be defined as the sum of actions completed by the player during a match and/or training (e.g., running 3000 m). Internal load can be defined as the physiological response of the body to the external load (e.g., heart rate). A model for monitoring the load was proposed by researchers over the past decade, showing a correlation with the occurrence of non-contact muscle injuries . According to this model, the ratio of recent load (last week) to chronic load (last four weeks) is calculated. For example, if the total distance in the last week was 20,000 m, while in the previous three weeks, it was 18,000 m, 21,000 m, and 19,000 m, respectively, then the ratio is calculated as follows: ACWR = 20,000/average (20,000 + 18,000 + 21,000 + 19,000) = 1.03. Researchers suggest that when this ratio exceeds 1.5, the risk of player injury increases . However, over time, sports scientists have tested modified models, considering the last two or three weeks in chronic load (referred to as ACWR 1:2 or 1:3) or excluding the week of acute load from the chronic load . The ACWR has been utilized in team sports such as football , rugby , and Australian football .

Content: Future studies should focus more on the following aspects: (1) There are still some differences in the definition of injury types and severity in current studies, and overall injuries should include all types of injuries in the study. Future studies should select more homogeneous injured players, according to more specific injury definitions, and combine the injury mechanism to clearly understand the quantification of the relationship between workload and a certain type of injury. (2) The current study duration ranges from a certain stage of the season (training camp, pre-season, or mid-season) to one or more seasons, and the number of subjects and the number of injuries are both small, which affects the effectiveness of the statistics. Future studies should conduct large-sample, multi-team, and multi-season research with complete records and reasonable statistics to improve the scope of the results and recommendations. (3) Given many current challenges, some scholars have called for a consensus metting in the field to provide evidence-based recommendations on the monitoring of training and match load in professional soccer . Simple measures such as ACWR and cumulative weekly load are becoming increasingly popular as soccer sports load monitoring methods, and discussing their relationship with specific injury types should take into account cumulative tissue damage, mechanical load, psychological-physiological fatigue, and recovery, which may contribute to a clear understanding of load-injury relationships. (4) In the future, the relationship between load and injury risk in high-level youth soccer players should be explored. The availability to train and gain match exposure are likely essential for high-level young soccer players to develop their physical fitness, and to improve the technical and tactical skills necessary for adult soccer players . Sustaining an injury reduces a player's availability and may also impair the progress of their development and future career opportunities .

Abstract: The number of studies on the relationship between training and competition load and injury has increased exponentially in recent years, and it is also widely studied by researchers in the field of professional soccer. In order to provide practical guidance for workload management and injury prevention in professional athletes, this study provides a review of the literature on the effect of load on injury risk, injury prediction, and interpretation mechanisms. The results of the research show that: (1) It appears that short-term fixture congestion may increase the match injury incidence, while long-term fixture congestion may have no effect on both the overall injury incidence and the match injury incidence. (2) It is impossible to determine conclusively whether any global positioning system (GPS)-derived metrics (total distance, high-speed running distance, and acceleration) are associated with an increased risk of injury. (3) The acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) of the session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) may be significantly associated with the risk of non-contact injuries, but an ACWR threshold with a minimum risk of injury could not be obtained. (4) Based on the workload and fatigue recovery factors, artificial intelligence technology may possess good predictive power regarding injury risk.

Content: Soccer has evolved and games are played faster and more aggressively than in the past, requiring elevated fitness levels . To meet these physical demands, soccer players have to be exposed to systematic and appropriate training regimes taking into account the balance between training load (TL; the combination of training volume, intensity, and frequency) and recovery . TLs that are too low are insufficient to induce a functional, adaptive response. However, training too hard increases the risk of health problems, such as overtraining and injuries . The high injury incidence in professional soccer players, ranging from 2.48 injuries to 9.4 injuries per 1000 h of exposure, suggests that finding the right balance between training, matches, and recovery is one of the biggest challenges soccer coaches and their staff face. Adolescence, the period of life between childhood and adulthood, is a critical time in a soccer player ' s career , and during this period, injuries can have a detrimental effect on future performance [7, 8] and career opportunities [9 -12]. Unfortunately, injury risk in elite youth soccer players is even higher compared to their professional counterparts, ranging from 2.0 to 19.4 injuries per 1000 h of exposure, with match injury incidence as high as 48.7 injuries per 1000 h of match exposure.

While the teams of the control group were asked to train as usual, the intervention group received a special proprioceptive training programme of increasing difficulties in addition to their standard training. The players were instructed to train at least 20 minutes per day during the pre-season training and at least three times a week during the season. Over the three-season observation period, the incidence of ACL injuries was significantly lower in the intervention group (0.15 injuries per team/season) compared with the control group (1.15 injuries per team/season). Hewett et al. investigated the effects of a neuromuscular programme on the incidence of knee injuries in female soccer, volleyball and basketball players. Coaches and trainers from 12 area high schools were sent an instructional video and training manual demonstrating the training programme that incorporated flexibility, plyometrics and weight training to increase muscular strength and decrease landing forces. Fifteen teams (366 girls including 97 soccer players) participated in the 6-week pre-season neuromuscular programme and 15 teams (463 girls including 193 soccer players) did not. The incidence of serious knee injuries monitored over an entire season was significantly lower in the trained group (0.43 per 1000 player exposures) than in the untrained group (0.12 per 1000 player exposures). For soccer players only, a trend towards a higher incidence in the untrained group (0.56 per 1000 player exposures) than in trained group (0 per 1000 player exposures) was observed.

Content: The correlation between the weekly cumulative load of s-RPE and the risk of noncontact injury cannot be determined. Mc Call et al. concluded that weekly load was not significantly associated with non-contact injuries , and another study of elite young professional players showed that weekly load was not associated with non-contact injuries . Delecroix's findings for players of different ages varied, with weekly cumulative load in U19 athletes not independent of the overall incidence of injury, and weekly cumulative load in U21 athletes positively correlated with injury risk . Unlike the results of the three studies mentioned above that investigate full seasons, two studies on the pre-season period concluded that weekly loads were associated with non-contact injuries. The risk of contact and non-contact injuries at 1500-2120 AU was significantly higher than at &lt;1500 AU under a pre-season weekly load . In another pre-season study, both 3- and 4-week cumulative loads were associated with the incidence of non-contact injuries . The main reasons may be that athletes experience decreased physical fitness after the offseason, and the excessive cumulative load in the early season causes soft tissue injuries . In addition, more pre-season training by several European teams was not associated with the incidence of injuries during the season, but 10 more training sessions reduced the incidence of serious injuries in matches by 0.18 injuries/1000P-H and increased match attendance by 1% . This suggests that excessive cumulative loads early in the season can lead to an increased risk of injury, while gradually increasing the training load and avoiding a rapid increase in load can have a protective effect during the season.

Content: All of the studies discussed in this review take male professional elite soccer players as their research objects, and the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) It appears that short-term schedule congestion leads to an increase in the incidence of match injuries, while long-term schedule congestion has no effect on the incidence of overall injuries and match injuries. (2) It is impossible to determine conclusively whether any global positioning system (GPS)-derived workload metrics (total distance, high-speed running distance, and accelerations) are associated with an increased risk of injury. (3) It seems that the ACWR of s-RPE was significantly correlated with the risk of non-contact injury, while the ACWR threshold with the lowest risk of injury could not be determined. (4) Based on the training load and fatigue recovery factors, the use of AI may have a good predictive effect on injury risk.

Content: Implementation of a Structured Warm-up and Cool-down Programme: A thorough warm-up before training or competition and an adequate cool-down process afterwards can reduce the risk of injury. The programme should include specific exercises that increase blood flow to the muscles and improve flexibility, especially in areas most commonly affected by injury. Body Awareness and Balance Training: Improving body awareness and balance through proprioceptive exercises can strengthen players' ability to control their movements and reduce the risk of falling or moving unnaturally, which can lead to injury. Use of Evidence-Based Rehabilitation Techniques: Healthcare professionals should adopt rehabilitation techniques that are supported by current scientific evidence. This includes manual therapy, strengthening and flexibility exercises, and the use of rehabilitation technologies such as biofeedback and laser therapy. Player Education: Educating players on the importance of following rehabilitation protocols, early recognition of injury symptoms, and injury prevention strategies is key to ensuring quick and effective recovery and preventing re-injury. Personalising Rehabilitation Protocols: Recognising that every athlete and injury is unique, it is crucial to tailor the rehabilitation programme to each individual's specific needs, including considering the type of injury, severity, and sporting goals of the player. Multidisciplinary Team Collaboration: Close cooperation between coaches, physiotherapists, sports psychologists and other healthcare professionals can speed up the recovery process and ensure a holistic approach to injury rehabilitation. Adopting this approach in daily practice will help maximise player well-being and minimise downtime due to injury, allowing them to return to the field faster and in the best condition possible.

Content: The ACWR was introduced in the previous decade with the aim of monitoring training loads to prevent non-contact injuries. This ratio is formed with the acute load in the numerator, representing the player's workload in the last week, and the chronic load in the denominator, representing the workload over the last 2, 3, or 4 weeks. Researchers attempted to provide specific thresholds for the ACWR to limit the likelihood of noncontact injuries. The proposed ideal range for the ratio was between 0.8 and 1.3, with an increased injury probability when the ratio exceeded 1.5 or was below 0.8, forming a U-shaped relationship . In a previous study, it was noted that different sports may have different thresholds in the relationship between training load and injury . This variability was one of the reasons for focusing on adult professional football players in the current review.

Content: As it is likely that you will find a wide variety of these considerations and particularities within your team, the safest approach is to introduce the sprint in a very progressive manner from the preseason : avoid spikes in volume and intensity, which could cause injury and allow players to progressively adapt to sprint training . To progressively include these situations, we will use the 'control-chaos continuum' proposed by some authors for the rehabilitation of injured soccer players . In this approach, the prescribed tasks accumulate and increase in complexity based on the chaotic elements that compose them. In this way, we will be able to periodize the sprint training sessions throughout the different weeks of training, taking into account the complexity and specificity of the tasks. Initially, we will use tasks of high control and low complexity, where the number of stimuli is low. The individual analytical work (in a straight line or in a curve) is a very simple and pragmatic way to calibrate the dose and limit unwanted speed peaks during the first Sports 2024 , sessions. A collective finishing drill without opposition, over a maximum distance of 40 m, could be a good way to progress in specificity and complexity. As a player adapts to sprint training and increases the speed values, we can add chaos to the tasks and even combine different methods. We believe that if we expose the player to real game situations where they have to sprint, the protective effect will be greater since the coordination demands required will be more similar. In this sense, our training sessions should focus on the context of the game and not just on the frequency and duration of bouts the player performs . In the current conceptualization of high-intensity activity training, the 'why' is equal to or more important than the 'how much' . If we understand the physical-tactical context in which sprints occur, drill design can better reflect these physical demands using an integrative approach .

Content: Implementing an optimal training load in elite youth soccer training programs is of utmost importance to reduce the risk of injuries and attain peak performance. Training load can be categorized into two components. External load refers to the physical work performed during training or matches, such as distance covered and accelerations , whereas internal load comprises the psychophysiological response to the external load . Several studies in elite male soccer players have investigated the association between load and injury risk and concluded that players have an increased injury risk if the training load exceeds what their bodies can tolerate [16 -20]. This association has received less attention in elite youth soccer players. While training may provoke positive training adaptations in youth athletes, it is also likely that they will respond differently from their adult counterparts to a particular training load, resulting in different fatigue, stress, injury, or illness responses . Gabbett et al. determined the existing knowledge on the relationship between workload and injuries in adolescent male football players (i.e., American football, Australian rules football, soccer, rugby league, rugby union) and concluded that the balance between what is required to maintain or improve skill versus physiological performance and the association with injury risk is not well understood . Therefore, the aim of our study was to conduct a systematic review exploring the effects of external and internal training load on injury risk in elite youth soccer players. This enables coaches and staff to better understand the impact of training load on injury risk in this specific target group.

Content: Performing speed training on the MD-2 day is a controversial issue for which there are no scientific studies to help defend our position. Although a positive association has been found recently between training speed on the MD-2 day and a lower incidence of injury , some professionals consider that the accumulated load during the MD-4 and MD-3 sessions is sufficient, and exposing the player to speed work with this level of fatigue may be counterproductive . From our viewpoint, there are two key elements when it comes to justifying this training on MD-2: firstly, the volume and density of the efforts proposed, and, secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the assimilation capacity of our players to these stimuli (closely related to their experience in this weekly dynamic). Regardless of the periodization model used, our opinion is that we must be convinced of the importance of stimulating the sprint during the week, regardless of the selected day. In microcycles where a single match is scheduled, our way of proceeding is to analyze the high-speed efforts made on MD-4 and MD-3 so that, together with the individual needs of each player, we can adapt the dose of speed to be applied on MD-2. Of course, if the player presents high levels of fatigue due to the accumulation of neuromuscular load from previous days, perhaps maximum sprints should be avoided or reduced on MD-2. This neuromuscular fatigue could be assessed with some isometric testing protocols in the posterior chain, week by week in MD+1 (to control the neuromuscular fatigue after the match) or MD-2 (if you want to test the neuromuscular readiness of the player after MD-4 and MD-3 sessions). This protocol is highly sensitive to neuromuscular fatigue compared to other ways of measuring lower body neuromuscular fatigue (i.e., knee maximal voluntary isometric contraction), or internal load (i.e., RPE) after sessions with different volumes of sprints, accelerations and decelerations .

Among the 21 perceived modifiable risk factors, 12 were considered extrinsic factors (relating to coaching, team and club) and 9 suggested being intrinsic or player factors. Further, the importance of the factors, as expressed as the mean of the weighted averages, was 3.1 for the extrinsic factors compared with 2.9 for the intrinsic factors. A lack of communication between the medical staff and the coaching staff was perceived as the most important or second most important risk factor in both subgroups. The greatest difference between the two groups was the perception of style of coach leadership as risk factor, the group with higher hamstring injury rates (the HIGH group) perceived this factor as 57% more important compared with the teams with less hamstring injuries (LOW group). The HIGH group also perceived the player factors fatigue and wellness as more important compared with the LOW group.

Content: Predictive analysis is based on the ability to predict future outcomes based on historical data, and artificial intelligence (AI) has an advantage in managing individualized diverse data. Therefore, in recent years, some researchers have begun to try to use AI to predict injuries in soccer players. Mandorino et al. used s-RPE and total recovery quality to quantify the internal training/game load and recovery status of soccer players, respectively, and calculated the cumulative load (2, 3, and 4 weeks) and ACWR (1:4). The classification tree model displayed good discrimination (AUC = 0.76), low recovery status, a rapid increase in training load, and cumulative load and maturity were identified by data mining algorithms as the most important injury risk factors . Vallance et al. used GPS data and subjective questionnaire data (sleep quality, fatigue, etc.) to apply a variety of classification machine learning algorithms and found that the internal loads were more accurate than 1-week injury prediction external loads, while for 1-month injury prediction, the best performances by the classifiers were reached by combining internal and external loads . Mandorino et al. believe that the support vector machine (SVM) is the best prediction tool for the risk of muscle injury in young soccer players (AUC = 0.84) and use the decision tree algorithm to understand the interactions identified by the SVM model, assessing how the risk of injury could change according to players' maturity status, neuromuscular fatigue, anthropometric factors, higher workloads, and low recovery status . In addition to the application of AI, the above prediction model adds fatigue recovery factors to the workload and injury risk in order to establish a causal relationship between load, fatigue recovery, and injury risk, which helps to determine the reasonability of specific injury risk factors and load measures

Content: Load Evidence regarding load-injury relationships among soccer players is still emerging as reviews remain sparse in this area of inquiry. Current evidence across team sports indicates that load, in terms of player exposure and/or exertion, could either be an independent protective or risk factor for injury, depending on whether load administration is optimal and progressive or suboptimal (e.g., load spike), respectively, and that this relationship is likely moderated by other risk factors for injury [35 -40]. Prospective studies showed that a high amount of absolute (accumulated or cumulative) load, based on different calculations of load measures (e.g., 1weekly, 2-weekly), was associated with greater risk of injury among elite youth and professional soccer players [39 -41]. These findings suggest that it may be expedient to have an absolute load threshold, for example, weekly load threshold, to further mitigate injury risk in soccer, especially youth soccer [39, 40]. Altogether, available evidence suggests that avoiding a spike in load (e.g., the acute to chronic workload ratio) is associated with less soccer injuries [39 -41].

Content: Injury prevalence was reported inconsistently across the analyzed studies, employing diverse metrics such as injuries per 1000 h of exposure or the percentage of athletes injured over a 12-month period. This inconsistency aligns with findings from previous systematic reviews , where the lack of standardized reporting frameworks complicates direct comparisons across studies. This variability underscores the need for standardized injury surveillance methods to improve data comparability in swimming research. Injury rates were consistently reported to be higher during competitions than training, likely due to the increased intensity, physical demands, and cumulative overload associated with competitive events . These findings emphasize the need for load management strategies during competitive periods to mitigate the heightened injury risk. The primary tools for injury measurement across the reviewed studies were questionnaires, which, although widely used for their feasibility and standardization, may not capture the multifactorial nature of injuries or subclinical issues effectively . For example, while the LEAF-Q offers a targeted approach to assessing risks related to the FAT , it lacks sensitivity for identifying broader biomechanical or overuse injuries. Conversely, technological tools such as SIMS-Med Sport Systems provide a more dynamic approach, enabling real-time injury monitoring and the longitudinal tracking of athletes' health . Despite their potential, such tools remain underutilized in swimming research. Future studies should focus on integrating wearable sensors, digital tracking systems, and validated questionnaires for a more accurate injury assessment. These innovations can significantly enhance the accuracy, comparability, and depth of injury data, facilitating the development of tailored preventive strategies and contributing to evidence-based interventions.

Content: In a prospective controlled intervention study, Junge et al. investigated whether the incidence of soccer injuries in male youth players could be reduced by education and supervision of players and coaches. Seven teams took part in the prevention programme, while seven teams of the same age and skill levels were instructed to train and play soccer as usual. The prevention programme included general interventions, such as appropriate warm-up, taping of unstable ankles, adequate rehabilitation and promotion of the spirit of fair play as well as exercises to improve the stability of ankle and knee joints, the flexibility and power of the trunk, hip and leg muscles, coordination, reaction time and endurance. The coaches were educated and supervised through courses, practical demonstrations and individual consultations given by a sports scientist. During the 1-year study period, the teams of the intervention group were looked after by a physiotherapist who attended one training session per week and supervised the warm-up, cool-down, performance of previously described exercises and rehabilitation of injured players. The incidences of injury per 1000 hours of training and playing soccer were 6.7 in the intervention group and 8.5 in the control group, which equates to 21% fewer injuries. The greatest effects of the intervention were seen for mild injuries, overuse injuries and injuries incurred during training. Low-level teams benefited more from the prevention programme than those of a high skill level.

Content: 4.1. Relationship between Game Load and Injury Risk in Soccer Players 4.1.1. Effect of Competition Calendar Congestion on Injury Risk in Soccer Players Exposure refers to the number of times or duration of a player's participation in a competition monitored during competitions with other teams. It is the most basic method for monitoring external load. European professional teams currently play 50-80 matches in a ~40 week season, thus regularly playing two matches per week, with some completing as many as three matches in a weekly microcycle . The increase in the number of athletes participating in competitions for a short or long period is called fixture congestion or match congestion. The precise definition of a dense schedule is when the recovery time between at least two games is less than 96 h, and its impact on players' match performance and risk of injury has been widely studied. Short-term match congestion refers to the number of days between players participating in two consecutive matches, and long-term match congestion refers to the total length or frequency of the athlete's exposure to matches in the past 20 days.

An observation regarding the type of variables used for the ACWR and the findings is that the majority of studies using the RPE indicator (4 out of 6) did not observe a relationship between the ratio value and the likelihood of injury. The RPE indicator reflects the internal workload and has been suggested to mirror the external load on the player . However, it is not a direct measurement indicator, and this detail may affect the outcome of the ratio. This ratio flips in studies using external workload indicators from GPS devices (four studies found a relationship, and two did not). Moreover, one of the two studies that did not find a relationship had a duration of only 10 weeks, a time frame that may not be sufficient for injury occurrence and ratio assessment. Finally, these two studies applied the uncoupled ACWR, in contrast to the other four studies that applied the coupled ACWR.

Hagglund et al., (2013) claimed that higher player training and game availability resulted in greater performance in both domestic and European championships shown through improved rankings in the UEFA Season Club Co-efficient. In another similar study, Eirale et al., (2013) suggested that higher player game and training availability is correlated with a higher league championship position, coupled with more goals scored and overall better goal difference. (https://www.isspf.com/) Thus, clubs who keep their players healthy and fit perform better, probably due to the fact that those better players positively influence team performance, and of course because these so-called 'better players' can lead to the lack of team disruption &amp; lend themselves to consistency in team selection and performance, something that can reinforce team connectivity. Another factor significantly affected through injury is team finances. Studies coming from England (Woods et al., 2002), Switzerland (Junge et al., 2011) and the Netherlands (Letsellast Model, 2008) demonstrated the huge financial cost that football clubs experienced regarding players' injury. Not only do scans and operations lead to extensive finances in clubs, but the negative investment or poor return on injured players is a huge proportionate cost to the club (Hickey et al., 2014, Pritchett et al., 1981). <!-- image --> Keeping players healthy is the key to both the financial and performance success of team sport, hence developing a modern injury reduction philosophy within team sport especially football, is fundamental to the clubs operating level.

Content: Shoulder Rehabilitation Changes in training practices and improved research allow healthcare providers to manage shoulder pain in competitive swimmers better than ever before. In the past, the healthcare providers generally attributed shoulder pain to excessive training or too many repetitive overhead strokes leading to laxity and resultant impingement of the rotator cuff [33 -37]. Recently, a new treatment paradigm reveals no single cause for shoulder pain in swimmers but rather a cluster of contributing factors that can match the clinical presentation to the treatment . Edelman et al. offers a subclassification system for shoulder pain identifying a cluster of etiological factors: (1) predisposition, (2) fatigue, (3) injury-related (faulty) mechanics, and (4) tendinopathy . This model can guide the selection of homogenous subgroups for more effective treatment strategies as noted in Fig. 1. Identifying individual causes in the setting of this paradigm should allow targeted and more effective treatment.

Content: Keywords: swimmer's shoulder; swim strokes; biomechanics C ompetitive swimming has become an increasingly popular sport in the United States, with swimmers registered with USA Swimming topping 250 000 as of 2007. 20 Participation in swimming has steadily grown, with peak increases of membership in the year following Olympic competitions. Nearly 90% of the forward propulsive power in swimming comes from the upper extremities, 24 explaining the cause of shoulder pain and injuries. In fact, the most common musculoskeletal complaint among swimmers is shoulder pain. 5 Richardson et al 25 showed that the incidence of shoulder pain was 52% of elite swimmers and 27% of nonelite swimmers. In Mc Master and Troup, 19 47% of 10- to 18-year-old swimmers, 66% of senior development swimmers, and 73% of elite swimmers reported a history of pain in the shoulders. The frequency of pain in both studies was highest for the elite swimmers, which may be due to increased training time and number of years of swimming. instability, impingement, labral tears, or symptomatic os acromiale). 5 Year-round swimmers average 6000 to 10 000 m (6500 to 11 000 yd) per day in practices. Practices are generally held 5 to 7 days per week, often twice a day, up to 3 times per week. This equates to roughly 60 000 to 80 000 m of total swimming distance per week. 4,12,25 With an average stroke count at 8 to 10 per 25 m, swimmers perform 30 000 rotations of each shoulder per week, placing tremendous stress on the shoulder girdle and glenohumeral joint. There is a paucity of biomechanical information on the swimming shoulder. The movements in swimming are closedchain mechanics, meaning that the distal segment (ie, the hand) is the relatively fixed segment, whereas the body is moved over the top of the hand. In swimming, 4 competitive strokes are used for training and racing purposes.

Content: The painful swimmer's shoulder should be considered in the context of the entire kinetic chain. This approach allows identification of a weak link, which may contribute to the functional problem. For example, a proximal muscle weakness may put extra stress on a distal joint, which often results in dysfunction, pain, or injury. Sciascia 27 coined this phenomenon catch up : 'changes in interactive moments altering forces on distal segments.' Whereas the functional manifestation may present as shoulder pain, the underlying cause may be periscapular muscle fatigue or core weakness. The relationship between the function of the shoulder girdle and the rest of the body is well recognized in throwing athletes 8,17 and is relevant to the successful treatment of shoulder pain in swimmers.

Poor biomechanics, especially with fatigue of scapular stabilizing and rotator cuff muscles, leads to dynamic instability and impingement . A multitude of issues contribute to the ' swimmer ' s shoulder ' : a hypermobile glenohumeral joint combined with technique flaws or fatigue can lead to impingement of the rotator cuff . Hypermobility can be multifactorial: the swimmer may have a predisposition with shoulder laxity or may have a traumatic event. Microtears or stretching of the glenohumeral ligaments exacerbate static instability. Once these athletes fatigue, their rotator cuff cannot alone stabilize the humerus and the increased translation, especially upward or superiorposterior leads to overloading the rotator cuff tendon. Abduction and rotation with humeral head translation can result in contact of the posterior supraspinatus or anterior infraspinatus against the posterior glenoid rim and labrum -a condition also described as ' internal impingement. ' Fortunately, most of these cases can be treated with rehabilitation and a proper strengthening routine as well as improvement in potential stroke flaws .

Content: Stroke errors are potential risk factors for shoulder pain in competitive swimmers. 4,8,14,15 Swimmers are subject to shoulder impingement for approximately 25% of their freestyle stroke cycle, even when using proper biomechanics. 16 The mechanics of these swimmers may be a result of instruction provided by their youth swimming coaches or a stroke technique developed throughout their careers. These findings highlight the importance of proper instruction on stroke technique in youth swimming. The swimming motion is complex, and faulty mechanics may develop because of poor coaching, poor understanding by the swimmer, shoulder pain, or performance factors. The biomechanical errors of a dropped elbow during the pull-through phase and a dropped elbow during the recovery phase were most prevalent. Dropping the elbow during the pull-through phase places the propulsive muscles of the shoulder at a mechanical disadvantage by placing the shoulder in a more externally rotated position. 7 This stroke error is commonly identified by swimming coaches and can result in shoulder external rotation with horizontal adduction, placing the shoulder in an impingement position. 15 During the above-water recovery phase, the elbow should be kept higher than the wrist and should avoid a dropped position. 2,14 A dropped elbow during this phase may orient the humerus more perpendicular to the water, producing a shorter arc of motion and decreasing time spent in the impinged position. 8 This stroke alteration is incorrect, but it may be an attempt to avoid the impingement position of shoulder flexion and internal rotation. 8 This error could be the consequence of pain and not the cause. An elbow that enters prior to the hand causes the water to exert an upward force on the dropped humerus, leading to superior translation of the humeral head and subacromial impingement. 14

In 2007, more than 250 000 competitive swimmers were registered with USA Swimming, the national governing body. The average competitive swimmer swims approximately 60 000 to 80 000 m per week. With a typical count of 8 to 10 strokes per 25-m lap, each shoulder performs 30 000 rotations each week. This places tremendous stress on the shoulder girdle musculature and glenohumeral joint, and it is why shoulder pain is the most frequent musculoskeletal complaint among competitive swimmers. Evidence Acquisition: Articles were obtained through a variety of medical search sources, including Medline, Google Scholar, and review articles from 1980 through January 2010. Results: The most common cause of shoulder pain in swimmers is supraspinatus tendinopathy. Glenohumeral instability and labral tears have also been reported, but a paucity of information remains regarding prevalence and treatment in swimmers. Conclusion: Because of the great number of stroke repetitions and force generated through the upper extremity, the shoulder is uniquely vulnerable to injury in the competitive swimmer. Comprehensive evaluation should include the entire kinetic chain, including trunk strength and core stability. Keywords: swimmer's shoulder; swim strokes; biomechanics

In 1993, Mc Master and Troup published the first large scale United States survey documenting the prevalence of shoulder pain interfering with practice or competition to be 10-26% in a group of 1262 swimmers. 1 They also identified aspects of training that swimmers reported aggravated their pain, such as use of paddles, kickboards and stretching. Since that time, additional factors associated with shoulder pain and injury have been studied and the prevalence of shoulder pain in swimmers of varied ages and competitive levels has been well documented. 2,3 Given this high pain prevalence, it may not be surprising that a study of baseline shoulder function using the Kerlan-Jobe orthopedic clinic score reported that scores of NCAA swimmers are lower than those of athletes in other overhead sports, and are similar to injured athletes in other sports. 4 In addition, except for neurolysis for suprascapular neuropathy, arthroscopic surgery has had limited success in returning swimmers to prior competitive training volume and level. 5,6 Therefore, the mainstay of treatment for competitive swimmers is conservative management and Khodaee et al. report that most patients with shoulder pain shoulder cases can be treated with rehabilitation, a proper strengthening routine, and correction of stroke flaws. 7

Content: 90 percent of swimming performance originates from the upper extremity, and almost all of these injuries occur in the shoulder area (Pink &amp; Tibone, 2000). In line with this inference, Weldon III &amp; Richardson, (2001) reported that 90 percent of the problems of swimmers who applied to a doctor with different complaints were shoulder-related. Especially professional athletes should take good care of themselves to avoid these injuries. During periods of heavy training, good rest and nutrition are the most important principles of protection from these injuries. Sufficient amounts of carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, protein to recover muscle damage, and vitamin-supplemented nutrition to replace lost minerals. In some cases, taking sports supplements under the supervision of an expert may be beneficial. Supplements are known to increase performance as well as prevent injuries (Tatlici &amp; Cakmakci, 2019). Another important measure is to keep the flexibility of the shoulder area at an optimum level (Beach, Whitney, &amp; Dickoff-Hoffman, 1992) . Imbalance in the shoulder muscles can lead to deterioration of posture, and postural deterioration can cause injury risks (Kluemper, Uhl, &amp; Hazelrigg, 2006). In this direction, both flexibility and strength should be exercised together with functional training. In free, butterfly and supine swimming performances, the swimmer manages the upper extremity strength by adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder, and this often causes agonist-antagonist force imbalance (Birrer, 1986). Pink &amp; Tibone, (2000) reported in their study that adduction-abduction force imbalances in the shoulder were 2.05: 1 in swimmers and 1.53: 1 in non-swimmers

Content: This review confirms that the shoulder is the joint most frequently affected in swimmers, accounting for 39.04 1.95% of injuries across the analyzed studies . This aligns with findings by Sein et al. , where 91% of elite swimmers reported shoulder pain, and 69% of those undergoing imaging exhibited supraspinatus tendinopathy. The shoulder's biomechanical role in swimming, contributing to approximately 90% of forward propulsion , predisposes it to overuse injuries such as rotator cuff impingement, tendinitis, and instability . Repetitive overhead motions in swimming, combined with high training volumes, increase the injury risk . Moreover, factors such as muscular imbalances, excessive joint laxity, and poor technique further exacerbate the risk of shoulder injuries . Specific styles of swimming, such as freestyle and butterfly, involve extensive internal rotation and adduction of the shoulder, which increase strain on the rotator cuff . Differences in stroke mechanics, such as unilateral versus bilateral breathing, may create asymmetrical loading, increasing injury risk . These findings underscore the necessity of tailored preventive strategies. Effective interventions should focus on managing training loads, correcting stroke mechanics, and implementing shoulder-specific strength and mobility exercises.

Content: Because of the great number of stroke repetitions and the propulsive force generated through the upper extremity, the shoulder is vulnerable to injury in the swimmer. Similar to the throwing shoulder, the swimmer's shoulder is at increased risk when the muscles of the proximal segments of the kinetic chain fatigue. 8,17 Comprehensive evaluation should include the entire kinetic chain, including trunk strength and core stability.

Content: Artistic swimmers train their cardiorespiratory capacity by swimming mainly in freestyle, which adds to the repetition of the skills inherent to the discipline (arm actions in routines, rowing, and exercises on dry land) in training, and the large volume of hours of training (24), could explain shoulder overload. During these trainings, repetitive cyclic movement of the glenohumeral joint occurs (25). These repetitive and continuous movements generate great fatigue and friction between the different structures of the joint, which result in microtrauma to the rotator cuff, particularly the supraspinatus and sometimes the long head of the biceps (2), thus causing in /uni FB02 ammation and pain (26). Along the same lines, fatigue caused by pain generates a biomechanical alteration in shoulder movement that can trigger an injury (18, 27). Therefore, the repetitive practice of these actions for several hours daily could increase the risk of shoulder injury in artistic swimmers (5). Regarding knee injuries, a conditioning factor is the mixer kick that the swimmer uses to stay on the water ' s surface, while the arms move in the air (5). As it is a repetitive and widely used movement, it could be stated that the cause of the injury is mainly due to it excessive use (28). Furthermore, the frequency and technical intensity of the kick (29), together with a decompensation of the knee angle or a mechanical imbalance of the hip joint during it (29), could affect the movement pattern of this joint and cause medial joint pain (due to knee valgus) or anterior joint pain (due to abnormal tracking of the patella in the trochlear not chop the femur), which would increase the risk of injury (2). Therefore, the importance of teaching the technical execution of the beater kick and the breaststroke kick among swimmers is highlighted, in addition to carrying out adequate preventive work to avoid possible propulsive irregularities at a biomechanical level among athletes to prevent possible injuries.

Content: As soon as the athlete experiences increased pain, warm-up should be long and slow prior to training with intensity, distance, and frequency adjusted. Temporary avoidance of painful strokes or positions (typically, freestyle and butterfly) is recommended; absolute rest is rarely indicated because it often results in rapid deconditioning of the elite swimmer. 11 Hand paddles and pulling sets are discouraged because they stress on the shoulder and can exacerbate the injury. 30 A kickboard may be used with the elbows flexed to prevent shoulder impingement. This position may need to be modified to avoid forward shoulder elevation. Fins may also be used to maintain good body position while decreasing upper body stress. A pull buoy may change the position of the shoulder in the water and reduce drag. Athletes may tolerate breaststroke swimming without pain. Dry-land upper extremity weight training should be modified or eliminated. A strap around the upper arm over the biceps muscle (counterforce strap) may diminish the stress on the tendon. 36 The prevention strategy for knee pain in swimmers focuses on quadriceps strengthening (vastus medialis obliquus) and stretching. Hamstring stretching may also be advantageous. Athletes with inadequate hip internal rotation also benefit from flexibility exercises. 35 Butterfly swimmers require hip external rotators to power their kick from the gluteus medius and piriformis. During periods of relative rest, ice should be used judiciously and short courses (up to 1 week) of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication may be beneficial. Injection of corticosteroid into the subacromial bursa is a controversial option and should be limited to swimmers with constant pain.

Content: The shoulder was the most commonly injured anatomic location, consistent with previous studies on collegiate swimmers and divers. 3,4,5,6 The proportion of shoulder injuries increased to an even greater degree in the swimmer-only subset (Table 2), as did the proportion of overuse injuries. Competitive swimmers perform 10 times the number of movements of other overhand athletes, 16 and may swim up to 9 miles per day at the elite level. 17 The biomechanics of frequent overhead motion involved in most swimming strokes also predispose swimmers to overuse-type shoulder injuries, often referred to as 'swimmer's shoulder'. 17 Injuries associated with freestyle and butterfly, two strokes that put the most overhead stress on the shoulder, 17,18 were also the most frequent in this population. Of note, it has been reported that swimmers aged 13-18 years believe mild to moderate shoulder pain should be tolerated to complete practice and many use pain medication to complete practice. 19 Such attitudes in adolescents are concerning and present important considerations for swim coaches and ATs in this age group. While our data do not directly examine the effects of sport specialization on injury prevalence, it is important that involved parties understand the potential risks of routine medication use during adolescence as well as the long-term consequences of 'playing through' their overuse injuries.

Similarly, Hill et al. reviewed 29 studies to assess the risk factors for shoulder pain and injury, identifying clinical joint laxity, internal/external rotation, previous pain history, and competitive level training as moderately certain contributors, though no factors were deemed highly certain. These findings aligned with Barry et al. , who found no direct link between training load and pain, but suggested a potential connection to injuries and illnesses, while also emphasizing the methodological limitations. Additionally, Trinidad et al. reported a higher injury incidence in female swimmers due to anatomical, biomechanical, physiological, and psychological factors, while Tate et al. observed improvements in posterior shoulder endurance alongside reductions in disability with increased training load, albeit with decreases in internal rotation and horizontal adduction, which predisposed swimmers to overuse injuries. Despite extensive research on swimming injuries, systematic analyses of injury patterns and frequencies in regions beyond the shoulder, such as the knee and lumbar spine, remain scarce. Moreover, variability across swimming styles, competitive levels, and populations, along with the impact of specific training practices and equipment use, still require further investigation. Addressing these gaps could provide critical insights to improve injury prevention and management in swimming. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the patterns and frequency of injuries associated with swimming.

Content: Abstract: Swimmer's shoulder is a common condition among elite swimmers, often leading to pain and reduced performance. Fatigue can exacerbate this condition by affecting shoulder strength, proprioception, and range of motion, potentially increasing the risk of overuse injuries. This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the impact of physiotherapy treatment and the effects of fatigue on shoulder kinematics using inertial and magnetic measurement units (IMUs). Five male swimmers (aged 21-27) with at least 3 years of training and suffering from swimmer's shoulder pain participated in the study. The protocol included three sessions: dry front crawl exercises using one arm in the first and third sessions, and a fatiguing swimming exercise in the second. IMUs were used to capture 3D rotation angles, focusing on flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotations during the first and third sessions. Stroke amplitude was analyzed before and after the physiotherapy treatment and fatiguing exercise. The results showed a significant increase in internal/external rotation amplitude post-fatigue before physiotherapy ( p = 0.03), with a non-significant decrease in flexion/extension after treatment, suggesting improved shoulder stabilization. Despite these preliminary findings being based on a reduced number of participants, they indicate that physiotherapy may enhance shoulder motion control in swimmers with shoulder pain. Nevertheless, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these results. Keywords: inertial sensors; shoulder kinematic; swimming; physiotherapy

Content: In order to provide appropriate rehabilitation, knowledge of the factors associated with shoulder pain and injury is important for health care providers treating competitive swimmers. Both intrinsic and extrinsic variables have been cited in etiology of shoulder pathology. Extrinsic variables include number of years of swum 4,8 prior history of shoulder pain or injury, 3,9,10 and training variables, 8,10 such as acute:chronic workload ratio, which is calculated using the current training volume in relation to the rolling average of the volume of training over the prior four weeks. 11-13 A recent systematic review explored the impact of swim volume on various age competition levels and determined that adolescent swimmers experienced the highest level of shoulder pain although adult swimmers had a comparatively higher swim volume. 14 Intrinsic factors are specific to the individual swimmer, such as stroke technique, muscle force capacity and endurance, posture and mobility, and, if appropriately identified, may be amenable to change. 15 Although stroke characteristics, such as hand entry crossover during freestyle swimming, have been associated with shoul- der pain, the videotaping and complex stroke analysis techniques used by researchers may preclude their use in clinical practice. 11,12,16 The identification of clinical measures that assess possible contributors to shoulder pain in competitive swimmers is within the scope and ability of most clinicians. While authors have examined which clinical examination findings are related to pain and injury in the swimmers' shoulder, no systematic review has examined these tools in various age-group and competition levels. Changes in mobility and strength in the musculoskeletal system are inevitable across the lifespan; thus, it is reasonable to expect that risk factors for developing shoulder pain may change over time

Competitive swimmers average approximately 18,000 shoulder revolutions per week, mostly from freestyle training. 1,6 Current research on swimming biomechanics is limited, making it difficult for any coach, swimmer, or investigator to identify correct freestyle stroke technique that improves performance and decreases the risk of shoulder injury. There are studies that provide a theoretical basis for identifying errors in freestyle biomechanics that may place the swimmer in a vulnerable position for injury. 3,4,7,15,16 The freestyle stroke is traditionally broken down into 3 distinct phases: hand entry, pull-through, and recovery (Figure 1). Stroke errors during each of these phases have been linked to the development of shoulder injury (Table 1). Swim volume-induced supraspinatus tendinopathy with associated supraspinatus tendon thickening may be an intrinsic risk factor for the development of swimmer's shoulder. 11 Individuals with supraspinatus tendinopathy also had significantly greater supraspinatus tendon thickness associated with the hours swum and yardage completed per week. The volume of training is a significant contributor to the changes within the supraspinatus tendon and potentially the development of shoulder pain. Although this study did not evaluate stroke biomechanics, stroke biomechanics that decrease subacromial space can increase compression of the supraspinatus tendon and can result in supraspinatus tendon thickening.

These demands can strain the shoulder considerably, often resulting in pain or discomfort in this anatomical area. This results in adaptive structural changes that enhance the athlete's ability to execute the sport-specific movements more efficiently. However, these adaptations often come at the cost of normal glenohumeral joint biomechanics, increasing the risk of developing various pathological conditions over time . Swimmer's shoulder refers to shoulder pain experienced by swimmers, described by Kennedy and Hawkins as supraspinatus tendon impingement under the coracoacromial arch. Nowadays, many studies report that shoulder pain in swimmers should be considered multifactorial and can be caused by various conditions including subacromial impingement syndrome, overuse, muscle fatigue, scapular dyskinesis, as well as joint laxity and instability . Characterizing shoulder kinematics is fundamental to the diagnosis, objective evaluation of treatment, the recognition of altered patterns, and the identification of changes . In particular, in sports, the study of shoulder kinematics is also important to optimize performance and identify altered movement patterns to prevent injury .

A 2021 survey revealed that there were 2.8 million people aged six years and older competing on a swim team in the United States (US). 1 The non-weight bearing nature of the sport may lead people to believe that it is safe for joints. While this may be true for the recreational swimmer, elite swimmers may swim up to 14,000 meters and undergo 2,500 shoulder revolutions per day, 2 with competitive swimmers practicing five to seven days per week, sometimes twice daily. 3 It is therefore not surprising that shoulder pain is the most common orthopedic complaint in swimmers. A majority of high school competitive swimmers in one study believed that shoulder pain is normal, with 47% of this group reporting that they take pain medication regularly to manage their shoulder symptoms. 4 The most recent wide-scale study reporting the prevalence of shoulder pain in youth swimmers in the US was published by Mc Master and Troup in 1993, 5 who collected over 1,000 survey responses from swimmers aged 13-16 years who were selected for participation in USA Swimming-sponsored national training camps. The authors defined shoulder pain as pain that interfered with training or progress in training and reported that 9-26% of the swimmers were currently experiencing pain and 38-67% reported a history of shoulder pain. 5 Furthermore, the more years of competitive experience the swimmers had, the more likely they were to experience shoulder pain. 5 To date, there has not been another study from a diverse sample reporting on the prevalence of pain and disability in youth swimmers in the US, thereby accounting for possible changes in training over the past three decades.

The shoulder is an inherently unstable joint; therefore, muscle forces are critical for maintaining stability, proper motion, and painless function. 36 The greatest propulsive force in swimming is generated by adduction and internal rotation of the upper extremity. 2,3,28,31 The 2 major muscles involved are the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. 32 The training-induced adduction and internal rotation strength in swimmers can lead to imbalance and, thus, reduced glenohumeral stability. 25,48 The teres minor muscle provides an external rotation force and stabilizes the humeral head in conjunction with the pectoralis major. The serratus anterior and subscapularis are active throughout the entire swimming stroke. The serratus anterior helps to position and stabilize the scapula, and the subscapularis muscle acts as an internal rotator throughout the stroke. Their repeated contraction during swimming makes them prone to fatigue 31 (Table 1). Female swimmers, on average, have shorter arm strokes than those of their male colleagues and are, from a biomechanical perspective, at a greater risk of suffering an overuse injury, due to more arm revolutions per lap. 3

Content: Freestyle (commonly known as 'crawl') and butterfly strokes pose the highest injury risks among swimming styles, primarily due to the repetitive arm abduction and the elevation above the head required by these techniques . The repetitive nature of these strokes places significant stress on the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers, often leading to fatigue, reduced dynamic stability, and impingement syndromes . The shoulder joint, which plays a crucial role in swimming, is characterized by its extensive range of motion and is supported by ligaments such as the glenohumeral and coracohumeral . Despite this support, muscular coordination is essential to maintaining joint stability. Research highlights the importance of shoulder range of motion (ROM), along with a balance between strength and flexibility, as deficits in these areas increase the risk of conditions such as scapular dyskinesis and 'swimmer's shoulder' . In contrast, breaststroke swimmers are more prone to knee injuries due to the valgus and rotational forces generated during the whip kick, commonly referred to as 'breaststroker's knee' . Both butterfly and breaststroke styles are also associated with an increased risk of lumbar spine injuries, as the hyperextension required to maintain a streamlined position places considerable load on the posterior structures of the lower back . The cyclical nature of swimming, combined with high training loads, technical precision, and strength demands, further increase the risk of injury, particularly to the shoulder, knee, and lumbar spine .

Content: <!-- image --> Shoulder pain is the most frequent orthopaedic injury in swimmers, with a reported prevalence between 40% and 91% in elite swimmers. Swimmer's shoulder is a condition with a gradual onset due to repetitive activity and can be classified as microtrauma. Swimmer's shoulder usually presents as subacromial impingement involving the rotator cuff tendon, bicipital tendon, or subacromial bursa. Primary subacromial impingement involves compression of these structures between the acromion and greater tuberosity (due to usually a tight posterior capsule causing the humeral head to migrate anteriorly) or abnormal acromial morphology. However, primary impingement syndrome is less common in competitive swimmers than secondary impingement. Secondary impingement occurs through a series of impairments, usually in a swimmer with increased anterior glenohumeral laxity (shoulder ROM in swimmers often exhibit excessive external rotation and limited internal rotation). This shift in ROM towards increased external rotation is an adjustment to the demands on the glenohumeral joint allowing anterior laxity and greater demand on the rotator cuff and the long head of the biceps to reduce humeral head elevation and anterior translation. Chronic swimmer's shoulder can result in pathology of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum, and long head of the biceps.

Content: Studies have shown that shoulder injuries are inevitable in elite performance, regardless of young or adult swimmers (Kammer et al., 1999). Impingement is the leading cause of these injuries. It occurs when the pinching tendons rub against the acromion located on the roof of the shoulder joint. Most elite swimmers experience the impingement syndrome also known as "swimmer shoulder". Although it is common in all sports branches such as basketball, volleyball, handball and water polo, it is mostly seen in swimmers. In this syndrome, inflammation occurs in the tendons (tendinitis) and severe pain may also be centered on the neck or waist outside the shoulder. It is possible to be protected from this syndrome depending on many factors. The most important of these is to make stretching movements. However, there are factors that need to be considered while performing the movements, and the practices may differ from person to person. Stretching applications should be done in the same proportions to the back and front capsules. Greipp (1985) showed that shoulder pain will increase in cases of bad flexibility in the anterior shoulder region. However, keeping this flexibility at an optimum level is especially important for swimmers who are genetically prone to these injuries (Johnson et al., 1987).4

Content: It should also be recognized that there may be an acute exacerbation of an underlying chronic condition. For example, a swimmer with shoulder tendinopathy ( ' swimmers shoulder ' ) may have an acute exacerbation of shoulder pain due to a change in training volume or frequency [16, 17, 19]. A survey of injuries in a NCAA Division I collegiate swimming program reported that freshman had the highest rate of injury, supporting the relationship between a change in training and injury . A careful history is critical to determine if an apparently acute presentation of pain or injury is actually an exacerbation of a pre-existing problem. Acute exacerbation of a pre-existing, chronic injury is rather common. NCAA Division I collegiate swimming program found that 38 % of all injuries occurred during dryland training . Attention to technique and careful performance of dryland exercises is critical to prevent injury from these exercises. Relative rest of the irritated region and a focus on core strength and rehabilitation of supporting musculature is the key to treatment. Overuse Injuries Overuse injury risk in swimmers has been reported as high as 4.0 injuries per 1000 athletic exposure (AE) [16, 19 -22]. In a study of swimmers at the University of Iowa from 2002 to 2007, the shoulder and upper arm were the most commonly injured areas followed by the back and neck . In the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program study for a 4-year span, the rate of overuse injuries in men was 0.66 per 1000 AE and in women was 1.04 per 1000 AE . In a study of the 2009 FINA world championships, 171 injuries were reported (incidence of 66.0 per 1000 registered athletes) . The most affected body part was the shoulder and the most common cause of injury was overuse .

The research focuses on individuals experiencing swimmer's shoulder pain, a prevalent and debilitating condition among elite swimmers. Swimmer's shoulder not only affects performance but also poses a significant risk to long-term shoulder health, highlighting the importance of developing effective diagnostic and rehabilitation strategies. These preliminary findings demonstrate that magneto-inertial sensors provide precise quantification of shoulder rotation angles and allow for detailed measurement of stroke amplitude during dry-land simulations of the front crawl exercise. This technology offers valuable insights into kinematic patterns, enabling a better understanding of how fatigue and physiotherapy interventions influence shoulder mechanics. Swimming is a sport that requires high flexibility in terms of joint hypermobility defined as the ability to move the joints beyond the typical range of motion . From an anatomical perspective, this hypermobility is linked to impaired collagen, resulting in laxity of the connective tissue matrix. Such laxity compromises the stability of the joint capsule and increases the extensibility of ligaments, tendons, and skin, requiring

A decrease in scapular upward rotation during recovery may predispose the shoulder to impingement as the arms move into position to begin the pull phase, namely because of diminished serratus anterior and upper trapezius activity. 26

Content: Some swimming activities consist repetitive movements (Costill 1992). Injuries in the swimming branch are seen at a low rate, but injuries in the swimming branch can take a long time and are exemplified by repetitive micro-traumas . Many injuries result from faulty techniques or mechanisms, and an assessment of the swimming biomechanics of any injured athlete should be performed to identify errors that may contribute to injury. Injuries in swimming should not only be taken into account by competitive swimmers, but also by the many recreational, master and fitness athletes who participate. Most injured swimmers are adults, bringing with them additional age-related factors that the junior competitor does not have that can contribute to injury. Injuries of swimmers should be considered not only while swimming, but also other factors in land training. Rest and other measures are taken to reduce the symptoms of injuries and increase injuries (Mc Master 1996). In free swimming style (crawl), different muscle contractions occur in each phase of the movement, and the repetition of these phases should be coordinated. These phases are; arm entry, reach forward, traction, traction mid phase, arm exit, and mid recovery (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 1). These phases need to be done continuously and with a specific technique (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 2). Technically, deterioration will increase the risk of injury, and working with more than 20% of the serratus anterior continuous maximum force, which is one of the major muscles in this swimming style, can also cause injuries (Ozyilmaz, 2018). Especially in long-lasting freestyle swimming performances, the decrease in the strength of this muscle due to fatigue causes the rhomboid muscles to work more (Pink et al., 2011). When the performance is long enough to cause fatigue in the rhomboid muscles, the shoulder area is particularly vulnerable and the risk of injury is greatly increased.

Content: In 1991, Scovazzo et al 28 studied the painful shoulder in freestyle swimming. With impingement, the arm was placed farther from the midline on hand entry, with the humerus lower, in a dropped elbow position, with decreased anterior and middle deltoid, upper trapezius, and rhomboid activity. Cools et al 10 showed late recruitment of upper trapezius in shoulders with impingement syndrome. During the pullthrough phase, there was decreased serratus anterior activity with increased rhomboids activity, causing a net loss of scapular upward rotation and protraction. At the end of the pull-through, the symptomatic swimmers demonstrated an early hand exit, presumably to avoid the extremes of internal rotation. 28 The rhomboids showed increased activity to retract and elevate the scapula. During recovery, there was decreased anterior deltoid activity, which limited forward flexion, causing a more lateral entry of the hand. Yanai et al 33 reported that the hydrodynamic force exerted on the hand during entry could forcibly elevate the arm beyond normal maximum active flexion, placing the shoulder in a position of hyperflexion, causing impingement. Mean duration of impingement positioning during the freestyle swimming stroke was up to 24.8% of the entire stroke, with 14.4% of this occurring during pulling and 10.4% occurring during recovery. 33 Yanai found that swimmers experienced impingement on some stroke cycles and avoided it on others. Swimming technique was inconsistent in painful conditions, and shoulder actions were used in each stroke phase to prevent impingement. 32,33 It is unknown whether the stroke alterations seen in swimmers with symptomatic shoulders are the cause or a consequence of the pain.

Content: Acute Injuries Although most musculoskeletal problems in swimming are overuse injuries due to chronic overload, there are several acute types of injury that can occur in swimmers. Most truly acute injuries occur due to contact or direct trauma and are thus uncommon in a non-contact sport such as swimming. However, this can happen in swimming due to striking the hand on the wall at the finish of a sprint. Metacarpal fractures requiring surgery have occurred in elite-level swimmers. Hand and finger contusions and fractures may also occur by striking the hand on the lane line or by striking the hand of another swimmer. Foot injuries can occur from striking the foot on the wall during a flip turn. These mechanisms of injury can also lead to lacerations. Shoulder pain is common in swimming and is typically a chronic injury due to repetitive overuse. However, acute shoulder subluxation can occur in swimmers with underlying shoulder laxity. For example, the overhead position of the arm during hand entry in backstroke can predispose to shoulder subluxation [16, 17]. Swimmers often have some degree of underlying shoulder laxity, and this can predispose to acute subluxation. Patellar subluxation can occur in individuals with underlying generalized laxity and, although uncommon, can occur during breast stroke swimming . Acute meniscus tears are uncommon in swimming, but symptoms from a degenerative meniscus tear in an older athlete may be exacerbated by breaststroke swimming due to the forceful rotatory and valgus loads on the knee .

Content: Abstract: Swimming is a widely practiced sport with significant physical demands, placing athletes at a considerable risk of injury, particularly in the shoulder, due to repetitive high-intensity movements. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the patterns and frequency of injuries associated with swimming. Methods: A systematic search of the Web of Science, Pub Med, Scopus, and Sport Discus databases identified nine relevant studies. Results: The findings revealed a higher incidence of injuries in female swimmers compared to males, with the shoulder being the most frequently affected joint. This disparity is partially attributed to the Female Athlete Triad, a syndrome characterized by low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and poor bone health, which increases injury susceptibility. Other commonly affected regions include the knee, often associated with the biomechanical demands of breaststroke, and the lumbar spine, which is impacted by degenerative changes resulting from high training volumes. However, variability in the injury measurement protocols across studies limits their comparability and highlights the need for standardized methods. Conclusions: Based on these findings, professionals in the field can identify injury patterns to enhance diagnosis and treatment, design personalized prevention programs, implement early interventions, and innovate equipment and training methods to improve swimmer safety and performance.

The main focus of these training programs seems to be the spine and core strengthening . Strength deficits can play an important role in fatigue development. Madsen et al. found that the majority of swimmers demonstrated signs of scapular dyskinesis in the course of a 100-min swimming session . Through EMG analysis of the painful shoulder, Scovazzo et al. discovered muscle activity of the serratus anterior is significantly depressed through the important pull-through phase in swimmers with shoulder pain . Batahla revealed in the course of a swim season the internal rotators of competitive swimmers become proportionally stronger when compared to their antagonists, increasing muscle imbalance, and the risk of an injury process [50, 51]. Fatigue may lead to a short-term decrease in acromiohumeral distance . As a result, a dryland program focusing on the shoulder external rotators and the scapular stabilizers would be of benefit and should be recommended as routine prophylactic measures .

Several risk factors for shoulder pain have been identified in the literature. Tate et al. found that youth swimmers with shoulder pain, disability, and dissatisfaction reported a greater history of shoulder trauma, had greater years of competitive swimming experience, and had less participation in another sport compared to their less symptomatic counterparts. 3 However, this study included only female swimmers from a single geographical region of the US. 3 Since female youth competitive swimmers have reported a higher prevalence of shoulder pain than males 7 and training practices can differ across geographical regions, a widescale study including males and females across different geographical regions of the US would provide more generalizable data to identify swimmers at risk for shoulder pain and disability who may ultimately benefit from a prevention or intervention program.

Myers, Ph D, ATC || Background: Poor freestyle stroke biomechanics is a suggested risk factor for shoulder pain and pathology, but this has not been proven in biomechanical or clinical studies. Furthermore, the prevalence of these theoretical errors has not been identified, which would help coaches, athletic trainers, and researchers determine the most appropriate errors to focus on and develop interventions. Hypothesis: The majority of swimmers will present with at least 1 freestyle stroke error. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: Stroke biomechanics for 31 swimmers from a collegiate swimming team were captured using underwater/abovewater cameras. Each video was evaluated for biomechanical errors: a dropped elbow during the pull-through phase, a dropped elbow during the recovery phase, an eyes-forward head-carrying angle, incorrect hand position during hand entry, incorrect hand entry angle, incorrect pull-through pattern, and inadequate body roll. Error prevalence was calculated, and relationships among the errors were evaluated using chi-square statistics. Results: A dropped elbow during the pull-through phase (61.3%) and a dropped elbow during the recovery phase (53.2%) had the highest prevalence. A dropped elbow during the recovery phase was significantly associated with a thumb-first hand entry angle ( P = 0.027) and incorrect hand entry position ( P = 0.009). An eyes-forward head-carrying angle was associated with an incorrect pull-through pattern ( P = 0.047). Conclusion: Biomechanical errors potentially detrimental to the shoulder are prevalent among swimmers. Many of the errors were interrelated, suggesting that one error may lead to other errors. Clinical Relevance: These errors highlight the need for proper stroke instruction and evaluation to decrease the risk of shoulder injury in competitive swimmers.

Additionally, more competitive years of experience significantly predicted higher levels of pain. This is consistent with the findings of Mc Master &amp; Troup, who reported that the prevalence of shoulder pain increased with more participation time in swimming. 5 Given the consistency of results, it is advantageous and beneficial for coaches and clinicians to be aware of any prior history of shoulder pain or traumatic shoulder injury in their swimmers, understanding the association of this with further pain, disability, and dissatisfaction.

Consequently, swimming was not exempt from injury risks, particularly overuse injuries affecting the shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle, and back . Among these, shoulder injuries were the most prevalent. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revealed that 34.7% of injuries in collegiate male swimmers and 36.8% in female swimmers involved the shoulder . Reported rates of shoulder injuries among competitive swimmers ranged from 40% to 91%, primarily due to repetitive overhead motions and the biomechanical demands of swimming . Furthermore, overuse and non-contact injuries were more frequent in women, with 63.7% of injuries reported compared to 44.4% in men . This difference was attributed to biomechanical factors, as female swimmers performed more arm revolutions per lap, thereby increasing their exposure to repetitive stress . At the elite level, swimmers trained up to 14.5 km per day, completing more than 2500 shoulder revolutions daily, which significantly elevated their risk of musculoskeletal injuries .

Content: The increased injury risk in female swimmers is influenced by multiple factors, including biomechanics, training load, and competition level. Shorter limb lengths in female swimmers result in a higher stroke count per distance, increasing joint stress and the likelihood of overuse injuries . Additionally, lower muscular strength and altered movement patterns place greater strain on the shoulder, which endures continuous cyclical loading during swimming . The level of competition significantly influences the injury prevalence and anatomical distribution. Elite swimmers exhibit the highest injury rates, particularly shoulder tendinitis, impingement, and knee injuries, primarily due to higher training volumes and repetitive overhead motions . Trained (non-elite) swimmers also experience frequent shoulder and knee injuries; however, their injuries are more often related to joint inflammation and cumulative overuse rather than acute damage . In contrast, recreational swimmers present a lower overall injury prevalence, though shoulder impingement and tendinitis remain common . Additionally, elite swimmers show a higher prevalence of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine compared to recreational athletes, reinforcing the long-term impact of high training loads . Improper training load management-both excessive and insufficient-can increase the injury risk by disrupting the balance between stress and recovery . High-intensity periods, particularly during competitions, may expose female swimmers to greater risks due to cumulative fatigue and hormonal fluctuations, which can compromise joint stability and neuromuscular control . Additionally, repetitive movements, including shoulder rotations, turns, and push-offs, contribute to progressive tissue strain.

Content: The association between the volume of swim training and shoulder pain was explored in 12 studies. Authors of 4 of the 12 studies reported significant relationships in adolescent, 11,15,34 adult, 34 or masters-level 11,35 swimmers. Studies of young competitive swimmers showed no significant results. 11,28 In a cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging study of adolescent swimmers, 15 the number of swimming hours and weekly swimming distance correlated significantly with supraspinatus tendinopathy and shoulder impingement pain ( P , .005 and P .01, respectively). In the same study, thickness of the swimmer's supraspinatus tendon was associated with years in training ( P , .01) and hours per week in training ( P , .05), and all swimmers with tendon thickening presented with supraspinatus tendinopathy and shoulder impingement pain. 15 A second cross-sectional study 11 demonstrated differences in exposure of high school and masters swimmers but not young competitive swimmers ( P .18-.74). The number of years that high school swimmers were active in swim training was significantly associated with shoulder pain ( P .01). In addition, the researchers reported a greater number of hours swum per year by masters swimmers with shoulder pain compared with their pain-free counterparts ( P .02). A 12-month retrospective study of adolescent and adult swimmers 34 demonstrated that injured swimmers reported swimming more than noninjured swimmers (1612 versus 1380 km, P .04) and that the mean number of kilometers swum was higher in swimmers with at least 1 injury versus swimmers without injury (1750 versus 1437 km, P .03). A higher risk was also seen in swimmers with more than 700 exposure hours per year (odds ratio 2.10; 95% confidence interval 1.21, 3.61; P .008). Finally, a retrospective study by Kru ger et al 35 showed a negative association between exposure and pain in masters-level swimmers ( P .004), with a higher prevalence of shoulder pain related to lower volumes of training.

Content: Knee Up to 75 % of breaststrokers report medial knee pain . Medial knee pain can occur from strain on the medial collateral ligament, irritation of a medial plica, or, in unusual cases, medial meniscus tears. Patellar instability is another less common differential diagnosis to consider. Examination of the knee should be focused on evaluation of knee stability. Knee injuries from crosstraining such as weight-lifting, plyometrics, or running can be exacerbated by swimming. Improving hip flexibility and avoidance of an overly wide breaststroke kick will help decrease strain on these areas of the knee. Lumbar Spine Dolphin kicking plays an important role in modern swimming technique. With an increased emphasis on this facet of swimming comes risk of low back injury, as hyperextension with dolphin kicking can lead to pars interarticularis pathologies (e.g., spondylolysis). The L5-S1 disc is another common area of irritation with overuse. Similar to other areas of overuse in swimmers, dryland training, especially weightlifting, can exacerbate or cause back injuries [31, 32]. Also, similar to other areas of overuse, a prevention program with emphasis on core abdominal and low back strengthening can help prevent chronic low back complaints.

Content: Freestyle (commonly known as 'crawl') and butterfly strokes pose the highest injury risks among swimming styles, primarily due to the repetitive arm abduction and the elevation above the head required by these techniques . The repetitive nature of these strokes places significant stress on the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers, often leading to fatigue, reduced dynamic stability, and impingement syndromes . The shoulder joint, which plays a crucial role in swimming, is characterized by its extensive range of motion and is supported by ligaments such as the glenohumeral and coracohumeral . Despite this support, muscular coordination is essential to maintaining joint stability. Research highlights the importance of shoulder range of motion (ROM), along with a balance between strength and flexibility, as deficits in these areas increase the risk of conditions such as scapular dyskinesis and 'swimmer's shoulder' . In contrast, breaststroke swimmers are more prone to knee injuries due to the valgus and rotational forces generated during the whip kick, commonly referred to as 'breaststroker's knee' . Both butterfly and breaststroke styles are also associated with an increased risk of lumbar spine injuries, as the hyperextension required to maintain a streamlined position places considerable load on the posterior structures of the lower back . The cyclical nature of swimming, combined with high training loads, technical precision, and strength demands, further increase the risk of injury, particularly to the shoulder, knee, and lumbar spine .

Content: Knee pain figures range from 34% to 86% for a single knee episode, being highest in breaststrokers, <!-- image --> Knee pain is caused mainly during breaststroke swimming. Repetitive stress is placed on the medial knee produces pain during the whip-like motion. The breaststroke kick is a high valgus load produced during sudden flexion-extension, adduction and external rotation of the knee against the hydrodynamic environment, resulting in stress to the medial compartment. Hence a strain occurs to the medial collateral ligament and compression on the lateral knee (possibly causing sprain on the MCL; irritation of the medial plica; bursal irritation at the muscular insertions of the adductor and hamstring muscles). Strain injuries may also present in the adductor muscles (adductor magnus and brevis, especially) Other knee injuries include patellofemoral pain, and medial synovitis. Treatment will focus on elimination of inflammation. Rehabilitation should focus on stabilisation exercises for hypermobile joints, postural correction, strengthening and flexibility. A 2008 study found the 200 - 400 m breaststroke events increase the risk for knee overuse injuries more than other strokes or distances. Additionally training for more than four times a week increases the risk twofold for knee and fourfold for shoulder overuse injuries. A 2004 study looking at competitive swimmers interestingly reports that breaststroke swimmers are at significant risk of: groin injury; groin injury is positively correlated with increased magnitude of breaststroke training; and groin injury may prevent participation in practices and competitions. So take the time to assess then groin and complete length of hip adductors, not just distally.

Content: While the shoulder remains the most injured region among swimmers, this review also underscores the knee and lumbar spine as prevalent sites of injury. Degenerative meniscal tears were the most frequently reported knee injury, accounting for 16.50 0.83% of cases . These injuries are often linked to the biomechanical demands of the breaststroke, which impose rotational and valgus stresses on the knee joint . Such findings align with the work of Salerno et al. , who emphasized that the repetitive nature of the breaststroke kick, particularly when performed with improper technique or high intensity, amplifies knee joint stress and predisposes swimmers to overuse injuries. Regarding the lumbar spine, this review identified a high prevalence of disc degeneration, being reported in 68% of elite swimmers compared to 29% of recreational swimmers . This disparity reinforces the influence of training intensity, duration, and cumulative load on spinal health. Previous studies attributed lumbar spine degeneration to the hyperextension and rotation required to maintain a streamlined body position, particularly in strokes such as butterfly and freestyle . Butterfly and freestyle strokes place high stress on the lumbar spine because of the required hyperextension and rotation. Additionally, repeated flip turns and wall push-offs contribute to cumulative spinal load, increasing the risk of chronic pain and degenerative changes . These findings underscore the necessity of targeted injury prevention strategies. For the knee, emphasis should be placed on optimizing breaststroke technique, improving lower limb strength, and reducing valgus stress through specific conditioning programs. For the lumbar spine, incorporating core stabilization exercises, monitoring training volume, and ensuring adequate recovery are critical to mitigating injury risks in competitive swimmers, especially those exposed to prolonged and intense training loads.

Like most swimming pathology, overuse is the primary factor in causing Breaststroke swimmers have a fivefold higher risk of knee pain (relative risk, 5.1), although most occurs in the medial compartment, whereas freestyle has a reduced relative risk (0.5) for knee pain. 23 The biomechanics of the breaststroke generates high valgus loads due to the adducted hip position. Extreme hip abduction angles at kick initiation can be detrimental. For example, a study of 21 competitive swimmers reported that hip abduction angles of less than 37 or greater than 42 were associated with a higher knee injury rate. 46 Increased varus and valgus loads also occur in the knee in addition to rapid knee extension. Due to the kick style in the breaststroke technique, increased tension across the medial compartment and increased compression of the lateral compartment occur. 34 Clinical and arthroscopic examination of 9 breaststroke swimmers with medial knee pain found medial compartment synovitis in 7 swimmers. 21 Rovere and Nichols proposed that inflammation and fibrosis of the synovial plica cause medial knee pain; they found thickened and tender medial plica in 47% of breaststroke swimmers with medial knee pain. 37 There is increased strain of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) due to high valgus loads during the whip kick, which can present with tenderness of the femoral or tibial origin of the MCL. 19 Repetitive valgus loads may result in pes anserinus tendinitis or bursitis. 35 Strain injuries of the hip flexors and adductors (particularly adductor magnus and brevis) occur in breaststroke swimmers. 35

Content: Artistic swimmers train their cardiorespiratory capacity by swimming mainly in freestyle, which adds to the repetition of the skills inherent to the discipline (arm actions in routines, rowing, and exercises on dry land) in training, and the large volume of hours of training (24), could explain shoulder overload. During these trainings, repetitive cyclic movement of the glenohumeral joint occurs (25). These repetitive and continuous movements generate great fatigue and friction between the different structures of the joint, which result in microtrauma to the rotator cuff, particularly the supraspinatus and sometimes the long head of the biceps (2), thus causing in /uni FB02 ammation and pain (26). Along the same lines, fatigue caused by pain generates a biomechanical alteration in shoulder movement that can trigger an injury (18, 27). Therefore, the repetitive practice of these actions for several hours daily could increase the risk of shoulder injury in artistic swimmers (5). Regarding knee injuries, a conditioning factor is the mixer kick that the swimmer uses to stay on the water ' s surface, while the arms move in the air (5). As it is a repetitive and widely used movement, it could be stated that the cause of the injury is mainly due to it excessive use (28). Furthermore, the frequency and technical intensity of the kick (29), together with a decompensation of the knee angle or a mechanical imbalance of the hip joint during it (29), could affect the movement pattern of this joint and cause medial joint pain (due to knee valgus) or anterior joint pain (due to abnormal tracking of the patella in the trochlear not chop the femur), which would increase the risk of injury (2). Therefore, the importance of teaching the technical execution of the beater kick and the breaststroke kick among swimmers is highlighted, in addition to carrying out adequate preventive work to avoid possible propulsive irregularities at a biomechanical level among athletes to prevent possible injuries.

Content: The flutter kick in freestyle swimming requires repetitive quadriceps contraction, which may result in patellofemoral overload. 35 Increased patellofemoral contact stresses resulting in anterior knee pain also occur during wall push-off, due to forceful quadriceps contraction with the knee in a high degree of flexion, or during starts and turns when the knee is in a partial squat position. 35 These motions may present with patellar tendinitis. Abnormal kicking mechanics are often present in swimmers with knee pain. Underwater videos of breaststroke swimmers showed that symptomatic swimmers complaining of MCL tenderness had different whip kick patterns. 44 Swimmers with medial patellar facet pain keep their hips in more abduction and demonstrate greater hip and knee flexion, which cause medial facet contact on the intercondylar ridge. In contrast, those with MCL pain derotated and plantar flexed the ankles as the knees extended. A video analysis of breaststroke mechanics in patients with knee pain showed high angular velocities at the hip and knee, as well as increased external tibial rotation. 21 Extrinsic factors . Overuse in breaststroke swimmers contributes to knee pain and injuries. Knee pain in breaststroke swimmers correlates with the number of years of training, the volume of training, the caliber of the athlete, and increasing age. 38 A substantial increase in training volume and intensity in freshmen swimmers competing in the NCAA Division I contributes to the risk of sustaining swimming injuries. Freshmen swimmers suffer the most injuries compared with more experienced swimmers. 49 A survey of 341 elite swimmers showed the rate of knee injuries was 0.17 for every 1000 hours of swimming. 23 A survey of NCAA Division III college swimmers showed that females had significantly more knee injuries, as well as back/neck, shoulder, hip, and foot problems ( P &lt; 0.01). 39

Content: As soon as the athlete experiences increased pain, warm-up should be long and slow prior to training with intensity, distance, and frequency adjusted. Temporary avoidance of painful strokes or positions (typically, freestyle and butterfly) is recommended; absolute rest is rarely indicated because it often results in rapid deconditioning of the elite swimmer. 11 Hand paddles and pulling sets are discouraged because they stress on the shoulder and can exacerbate the injury. 30 A kickboard may be used with the elbows flexed to prevent shoulder impingement. This position may need to be modified to avoid forward shoulder elevation. Fins may also be used to maintain good body position while decreasing upper body stress. A pull buoy may change the position of the shoulder in the water and reduce drag. Athletes may tolerate breaststroke swimming without pain. Dry-land upper extremity weight training should be modified or eliminated. A strap around the upper arm over the biceps muscle (counterforce strap) may diminish the stress on the tendon. 36 The prevention strategy for knee pain in swimmers focuses on quadriceps strengthening (vastus medialis obliquus) and stretching. Hamstring stretching may also be advantageous. Athletes with inadequate hip internal rotation also benefit from flexibility exercises. 35 Butterfly swimmers require hip external rotators to power their kick from the gluteus medius and piriformis. During periods of relative rest, ice should be used judiciously and short courses (up to 1 week) of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication may be beneficial. Injection of corticosteroid into the subacromial bursa is a controversial option and should be limited to swimmers with constant pain.

Flutter kicking requires alternating motions of the legs. When performed correctly, the flutter kick agitates the water giving it the appearance of boiling water. The power of the kick comes from the hip flexors and extensors. The knee is slightly flexed and extended while the ankles are plantar flexed and inverted.

Content: The arm motion in the breaststroke initially resembles the beginning pull of a butterfly stroke. However, the breaststroke pull does not continue with the forearms passing under the body to the level of the hips, as in the butterfly stroke (Figure 5). Starting from a shoulder-flexed posture with elbows extended straight ahead and eyes forward, the swimmer turns the palms outward and slightly upward in ulnar deviation to the oncoming water. 9 Keeping the elbows high, the swimmer supinates the hands to get set for the pull-through phase. The shoulders are moved through internal rotation, adduction, and, finally, extension as the swimmer pulls forward in the water. The streamline position of the body is maintained as the knees flex and subsequently spread the feet slightly apart in a frogkick position. The head, shoulders, and upper body are lifted above the surface of the water as the shoulders adduct, with hands slightly in front of the chest. 9 The hips are externally rotated and flexed approximately 35; the knees are flexed 90; and the feet are everted and dorsiflexed as the swimmer lunges forward. This takes place between the pull and the kick such that the rhythm becomes pull lunge kick. 9 The swimmer then begins a powerful kick directly backward, keeping the feet everted to provide more propulsion to move the body forward. This kick is a powerful hip adduction motion; the hips and knees are forcefully extended, returning the swimmer to the original streamline position. Pink 23 and Scovazzo et al 28 studied 2 general distinctions between the breaststroke and the freestyle: The breaststroke has a longer recovery phase, and the freestyle, a much longer pulling phase. In breaststroke, the shoulders stay in a high degree of humeral elevation compared with that of freestyle, and similar muscle activity is found with pull-through on the nonpainful shoulder.

Content: Likewise, trunk and spine injuries could lie in errors made during training, such as excessive repetitions, explosive speeds, arching with an excessive rotational component, inadequate neuromuscular training, poor stability, core strength and posture, as well as poor /uni FB02 exibility training (2). These errors have generated an increase in the prevalence of low back pain syndrome due to repetitive and rapid arching (5). Some movements performed during warm-ups have also required that the lumbar spine be maintained in hyperextension, as this achieves a streamlined body position; this can place excessive load in the lower back (27). Consequently, teaching, correcting and maintaining good swimming technique, modifying the frequency, strength, speed, and degree of hyperextension in the acute phase (5), as well as strengthening the lumbopelvic complex area (30), could help reduce the risk of injuries, especially in the trunk and lumbar spine of artistic swimmers (2, 31).

Content: Some swimming activities consist repetitive movements (Costill 1992). Injuries in the swimming branch are seen at a low rate, but injuries in the swimming branch can take a long time and are exemplified by repetitive micro-traumas . Many injuries result from faulty techniques or mechanisms, and an assessment of the swimming biomechanics of any injured athlete should be performed to identify errors that may contribute to injury. Injuries in swimming should not only be taken into account by competitive swimmers, but also by the many recreational, master and fitness athletes who participate. Most injured swimmers are adults, bringing with them additional age-related factors that the junior competitor does not have that can contribute to injury. Injuries of swimmers should be considered not only while swimming, but also other factors in land training. Rest and other measures are taken to reduce the symptoms of injuries and increase injuries (Mc Master 1996). In free swimming style (crawl), different muscle contractions occur in each phase of the movement, and the repetition of these phases should be coordinated. These phases are; arm entry, reach forward, traction, traction mid phase, arm exit, and mid recovery (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 1). These phases need to be done continuously and with a specific technique (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 2). Technically, deterioration will increase the risk of injury, and working with more than 20% of the serratus anterior continuous maximum force, which is one of the major muscles in this swimming style, can also cause injuries (Ozyilmaz, 2018). Especially in long-lasting freestyle swimming performances, the decrease in the strength of this muscle due to fatigue causes the rhomboid muscles to work more (Pink et al., 2011). When the performance is long enough to cause fatigue in the rhomboid muscles, the shoulder area is particularly vulnerable and the risk of injury is greatly increased.

Content: Musculoskeletal pain caused by heavy training from swimming is very common. Proper swimming techniques can prevent injuries and pain. Coaches should identify and change the wrong hitting techniques that cause pain. It is important to add the necessary strength and stretching movements to training to prevent pain. Lower extremity muscle strengthening and flexibility exercises should be routinely included for breaststroke swimmers. As soon as the athlete feels pain, the training intensity, distance and frequency should be adjusted. <!-- image -->

Content: Muscle-tendon and joint (non-bone) and ligament injuries are closely associated with the location and mechanism of the injuries mentioned above, since they are a consequence of rapid and repetitive movements in the areas of the shoulder, knee, and trunk (lumbosacral) (27, 28). For example, the repetitive motion of the synchronised kick causes great stress on the ligaments and tendons of the knee joint (27, 29). Likewise, the literature has found spinal disorders, such as scoliosis, hyperlordosis, hyperkyphosis, and low back pain syndrome (2). The need to maintain the most aerodynamic and ef /uni FB01 cient position possible through hyperextension, together with the constant rotation and arching of the trunk, generates a great overload in the lumbar area that could give rise to different tendon, ligament, or muscular pathologies (5, 27). On the other hand, the high number of bruises and concussions observed in the study by Steacy (19) could be due to the performance of some stunts (33). Therefore, it could be stated that special attention to the correct technical execution of speci /uni FB01 c elements of artistic swimming (such as the beater kick, positions with lumbar hyperextension, and acrobatics), greater strengthening of the muscles involved, together with a program to prevent ligament, muscular, and tendon injuries, it could reduce the risk of injuries in artistic swimmers.

The knee is the second-most-reported source of pain in competitive swimmers. 36 The prevalence of knee problems requiring an orthopedic consultation was 34% among the 35 members of the 1972 Canadian Olympic swimming team. 19 A greater incidence of knee pain occurs in breaststroke swimmers than in other swimming techniques. 19,21,46 A survey of 36 competitive breaststroke swimmers found that 86% had at least 1 episode of breaststroke related knee pain. 38 Quantifying the true prevalence of swimming-associated knee injuries is challenging, as structural abnormalities do not always correlate with painful symptoms and vice versa. Swimmers may have a number of knee abnormalities that take many years to become symptomatic, if ever.

Mechanical loading of the spine in competitive sports results in lumbar intervertebral disk degeneration. 4,8,26,33 A significantly greater proportion of swimming athletes had degenerative disk changes at one or more disk levels compared with a control group. 14 Sixty-eight percent of 56 elite swimmers (mean age, 19.6 years) and 29% of 38 recreational swimmers (mean age, 21.1 years) demonstrated degenerated disks at various levels. 18 There were no significant sex differences in the rate or among swimming strokes. 18 The main variables were training intensity, duration, and distance, suggesting that competitive swimming amplifies lumbar intervertebral disk degeneration. The L5-S1 levels are more frequently involved in elite swimmers. 18 Capaci et al concluded that 33.3% of butterfly swimmers and 22.2% of breaststroke swimmers experienced low-back pain. 9 Mutoch found a 37% incidence of pain for butterfly swimmers, while Drori et al reported a 50% incidence of pain for butterfly swimmers and 47% for breaststroke swimmers. 12,27 All swimming strokes maintain hyperextension of the lower back to achieve a streamlined position; this position is exaggerated in the 'undulating' style of breaststroke and butterfly. The high intensity and repetitiveness of these strokes load the posterior structures of the lumbar spine, which can result in spondylolysis and possible spondylolisthesis. 29 Increased intensity can increase the risk of damage. Muscle and ligament sprains can occur but settle rapidly with core stability programs and manual therapies. 15 Additional risk factors for the development of low back pain in competitive swimmers are training devices such as fins, kick boards, or pull buoys.

Content: The increased injury risk in female swimmers is influenced by multiple factors, including biomechanics, training load, and competition level. Shorter limb lengths in female swimmers result in a higher stroke count per distance, increasing joint stress and the likelihood of overuse injuries . Additionally, lower muscular strength and altered movement patterns place greater strain on the shoulder, which endures continuous cyclical loading during swimming . The level of competition significantly influences the injury prevalence and anatomical distribution. Elite swimmers exhibit the highest injury rates, particularly shoulder tendinitis, impingement, and knee injuries, primarily due to higher training volumes and repetitive overhead motions . Trained (non-elite) swimmers also experience frequent shoulder and knee injuries; however, their injuries are more often related to joint inflammation and cumulative overuse rather than acute damage . In contrast, recreational swimmers present a lower overall injury prevalence, though shoulder impingement and tendinitis remain common . Additionally, elite swimmers show a higher prevalence of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine compared to recreational athletes, reinforcing the long-term impact of high training loads . Improper training load management-both excessive and insufficient-can increase the injury risk by disrupting the balance between stress and recovery . High-intensity periods, particularly during competitions, may expose female swimmers to greater risks due to cumulative fatigue and hormonal fluctuations, which can compromise joint stability and neuromuscular control . Additionally, repetitive movements, including shoulder rotations, turns, and push-offs, contribute to progressive tissue strain.

Content: Abstract: Swimming is a widely practiced sport with significant physical demands, placing athletes at a considerable risk of injury, particularly in the shoulder, due to repetitive high-intensity movements. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the patterns and frequency of injuries associated with swimming. Methods: A systematic search of the Web of Science, Pub Med, Scopus, and Sport Discus databases identified nine relevant studies. Results: The findings revealed a higher incidence of injuries in female swimmers compared to males, with the shoulder being the most frequently affected joint. This disparity is partially attributed to the Female Athlete Triad, a syndrome characterized by low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and poor bone health, which increases injury susceptibility. Other commonly affected regions include the knee, often associated with the biomechanical demands of breaststroke, and the lumbar spine, which is impacted by degenerative changes resulting from high training volumes. However, variability in the injury measurement protocols across studies limits their comparability and highlights the need for standardized methods. Conclusions: Based on these findings, professionals in the field can identify injury patterns to enhance diagnosis and treatment, design personalized prevention programs, implement early interventions, and innovate equipment and training methods to improve swimmer safety and performance.

As swimming athletes are positioned horizontally in the water, gravity and buoyancy forces are traveling through the body with the potential to cause changes at the lumbar spine.

As the hands enter the water, the palms are turned outward (internal rotation with full pronation), and the upper trapezius, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus have high activity, along with the anterior, middle deltoid, and rhomboids. 22 The elbows bend as the arms spread outward to position the hands and forearms to the high elbow position. This high elbow position provides leverage and a large surface area to pull the body through the water. 9 The hands may move closer together under the shoulders as the arms move toward a 90 forward-flexed position in front of the body, perpendicular to the body's long axis, with the arm pointing straight down. As in freestyle, the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior perform the majority of the pulling, with peak subscapularis and teres minor activity at this mid-pull-through phase. 22 The swimmer will flex the knees simultaneously and begin a downward kick, assisting in propulsion and hip position. From the 90 flexed position of the shoulders, the arms are rapidly drawn toward the midline and backward toward the feet, thrusting the hand backward to complete the stroke. The latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid, and rhomboids perform this end-of-pulling phase. 22 With the final thrust of the arms and the double-leg kick, the head and shoulders lift above the surface of the water for recovery. In contrast to freestyle, where breathing is to the side, in butterfly the breathing is generally performed forward. The arms recover with the elbows slightly bent, and the head submerges just before the hands enter the water. 9 The bent-elbow recovery reduces the moment arm to improve stroke efficiency, and it reduces strain on the upper back and arm muscles. Because both scapulae and arms must be simultaneously elevated, upper trapezius activity peaks as the hands exit the water, and rhomboid activity peaks at midrecovery. 22 All other muscle activity during recovery matches that of the freestyle stroke. 22

Content: 90 percent of swimming performance originates from the upper extremity, and almost all of these injuries occur in the shoulder area (Pink &amp; Tibone, 2000). In line with this inference, Weldon III &amp; Richardson, (2001) reported that 90 percent of the problems of swimmers who applied to a doctor with different complaints were shoulder-related. Especially professional athletes should take good care of themselves to avoid these injuries. During periods of heavy training, good rest and nutrition are the most important principles of protection from these injuries. Sufficient amounts of carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, protein to recover muscle damage, and vitamin-supplemented nutrition to replace lost minerals. In some cases, taking sports supplements under the supervision of an expert may be beneficial. Supplements are known to increase performance as well as prevent injuries (Tatlici &amp; Cakmakci, 2019). Another important measure is to keep the flexibility of the shoulder area at an optimum level (Beach, Whitney, &amp; Dickoff-Hoffman, 1992) . Imbalance in the shoulder muscles can lead to deterioration of posture, and postural deterioration can cause injury risks (Kluemper, Uhl, &amp; Hazelrigg, 2006). In this direction, both flexibility and strength should be exercised together with functional training. In free, butterfly and supine swimming performances, the swimmer manages the upper extremity strength by adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder, and this often causes agonist-antagonist force imbalance (Birrer, 1986). Pink &amp; Tibone, (2000) reported in their study that adduction-abduction force imbalances in the shoulder were 2.05: 1 in swimmers and 1.53: 1 in non-swimmers

It should be noted that distance events are almost exclusively freestyle events. We fully recognize that many swimmers participate in races in several strokes and different distances. It is likely that many of the swimmers categorized for a particular stroke in our study actually participated in many stroke specialty events.

Rolling the body toward the arm enables the large trunk muscles to pull. The elbow bends, reaching maximum flexion approximately midway through the pulling phase. Even with the elbow flexed, the hand does not break the surface of the water, because of the body roll to the same side. The arm continues pushing down toward the feet, finishing the stroke with wrist flexion, as if dribbling a basketball next to the hip.

During the recovery phase, scapular retraction and elevation should be performed in combination with humeral abduction and external rotation movements (Ozyilmaz, 2018). In this style, the arms form the propulsion mechanism, and lower extremity injuries are very rare. The area that dominates the movement is the shoulder and 80% of injuries occur in this area. Similarly in breaststroke style, although the legs are more active than the arms, the shoulder area dominates the movement. The arms start and progress simultaneously with full flexion and internal rotation movement, and body movement is centered around the hip (Ozyilmaz, 2018). In the butterfly and supine styles, as in the free style, it is a bilateral activity, not in a reciprocal, unilateral pattern. In water diving, both shoulders are flexed, abduction and internal rotation, extension and recovery in the traction phase, while the arms are in abduction-internal rotation, and the arms are brought back to extension from the water (Ozyilmaz, 2018). As can be seen, in all swimming sports, varying degrees of internal and external rotation, scapular retraction and protraction shoulder movements cause injury, irritation, inflammation, rotator cuff tears-tendinitis, shoulder impingement syndromes, tears around the shoulder cartilage in that area (Ciullo and Stevens, 1989) (Figure 2).

Competitive swimmers average approximately 18,000 shoulder revolutions per week, mostly from freestyle training. 1,6 Current research on swimming biomechanics is limited, making it difficult for any coach, swimmer, or investigator to identify correct freestyle stroke technique that improves performance and decreases the risk of shoulder injury. There are studies that provide a theoretical basis for identifying errors in freestyle biomechanics that may place the swimmer in a vulnerable position for injury. 3,4,7,15,16 The freestyle stroke is traditionally broken down into 3 distinct phases: hand entry, pull-through, and recovery (Figure 1). Stroke errors during each of these phases have been linked to the development of shoulder injury (Table 1). Swim volume-induced supraspinatus tendinopathy with associated supraspinatus tendon thickening may be an intrinsic risk factor for the development of swimmer's shoulder. 11 Individuals with supraspinatus tendinopathy also had significantly greater supraspinatus tendon thickness associated with the hours swum and yardage completed per week. The volume of training is a significant contributor to the changes within the supraspinatus tendon and potentially the development of shoulder pain. Although this study did not evaluate stroke biomechanics, stroke biomechanics that decrease subacromial space can increase compression of the supraspinatus tendon and can result in supraspinatus tendon thickening.

Myers, Ph D, ATC || Background: Poor freestyle stroke biomechanics is a suggested risk factor for shoulder pain and pathology, but this has not been proven in biomechanical or clinical studies. Furthermore, the prevalence of these theoretical errors has not been identified, which would help coaches, athletic trainers, and researchers determine the most appropriate errors to focus on and develop interventions. Hypothesis: The majority of swimmers will present with at least 1 freestyle stroke error. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: Stroke biomechanics for 31 swimmers from a collegiate swimming team were captured using underwater/abovewater cameras. Each video was evaluated for biomechanical errors: a dropped elbow during the pull-through phase, a dropped elbow during the recovery phase, an eyes-forward head-carrying angle, incorrect hand position during hand entry, incorrect hand entry angle, incorrect pull-through pattern, and inadequate body roll. Error prevalence was calculated, and relationships among the errors were evaluated using chi-square statistics. Results: A dropped elbow during the pull-through phase (61.3%) and a dropped elbow during the recovery phase (53.2%) had the highest prevalence. A dropped elbow during the recovery phase was significantly associated with a thumb-first hand entry angle ( P = 0.027) and incorrect hand entry position ( P = 0.009). An eyes-forward head-carrying angle was associated with an incorrect pull-through pattern ( P = 0.047). Conclusion: Biomechanical errors potentially detrimental to the shoulder are prevalent among swimmers. Many of the errors were interrelated, suggesting that one error may lead to other errors. Clinical Relevance: These errors highlight the need for proper stroke instruction and evaluation to decrease the risk of shoulder injury in competitive swimmers.

Content: Based on influences from Milt Nelms, Bill Boomer, Alex Nikitin, and Franz Resseguie I have come to understand the importance of an athlete feeling balanced in the water. Just like running and walking, to efficiently transfer energy from our body to forward motion we need to be balanced. This can probably be seen easiest with the breaststroke. Generally we tell a swimmer to pull, kick, glide and really on the glide we want them to reset so they are not overexerting themselves. So instead of the passive 'glide' on the extension I like to encourage my breaststrokers to actively 'balance' on the extension. There are multiple ways to work on balance. One of my favorites is to go three cycles and balance for three seconds and then restart.

Content: An extensive program of stretching, strengthening, and endurance training, in addition to stroke-specific mechanics instruction, should form the foundation of an elite swimmer's training regimen. Musculoskeletal injuries in this population usually result from cumulative, repetitive trauma. Careful monitoring of training volume, intensity, and duration by coaches and physicians will minimize overuse injuries and identify athletes at risk. 36 Endurance training of core muscles (strengthening, stabilization, and flexibility) is an essential component in any injury prevention program. Abdominal and scapular muscle strengthening should be emphasized in the dry-land training program. The goal of core and abdominal strengthening is to develop increased control of the pelvis by avoiding excessive anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis. 17,22 An endurance training and strengthening program for the shoulder and periscapular muscles, with emphasis placed Table 2.

Content: The shoulder was the most commonly injured anatomic location, consistent with previous studies on collegiate swimmers and divers. 3,4,5,6 The proportion of shoulder injuries increased to an even greater degree in the swimmer-only subset (Table 2), as did the proportion of overuse injuries. Competitive swimmers perform 10 times the number of movements of other overhand athletes, 16 and may swim up to 9 miles per day at the elite level. 17 The biomechanics of frequent overhead motion involved in most swimming strokes also predispose swimmers to overuse-type shoulder injuries, often referred to as 'swimmer's shoulder'. 17 Injuries associated with freestyle and butterfly, two strokes that put the most overhead stress on the shoulder, 17,18 were also the most frequent in this population. Of note, it has been reported that swimmers aged 13-18 years believe mild to moderate shoulder pain should be tolerated to complete practice and many use pain medication to complete practice. 19 Such attitudes in adolescents are concerning and present important considerations for swim coaches and ATs in this age group. While our data do not directly examine the effects of sport specialization on injury prevalence, it is important that involved parties understand the potential risks of routine medication use during adolescence as well as the long-term consequences of 'playing through' their overuse injuries.

Content: Artistic swimming is a sport whose practice and popularity has been growing in recent years, increasing the physical and psychological demands, and causing swimmers to acquire an increasingly athletic pro /uni FB01 le (1). Unlike other sports, it combines swimming, gymnastics, dance and ballet. Therefore, the requirements for strength, endurance, and /uni FB02 exibility, as well as the levels of execution technique, are greater to achieve performance (2). This implies great physical and mental exhaustion in collective and individual training, which can increase the risk of injuries. Injuries have a negative impact on swimmers, sometimes generating chronic pain or even the need for surgery, which causes a high number of absences from training and/or competitions (3). Additionally, in some cases, it can cause disability or withdrawal from the sport. Therefore, the development of effective preventive measures to reduce injuries is imperative to maintain the performance and health of the athlete in this discipline (2). As in all aspects of sports medicine, knowledge of the epidemiology of injuries within a sports discipline (incidence, location, type, severity) allows establishing individualised guidelines and strategies, according to speci /uni FB01 c needs (4). Several articles have described that the most common injuries in artistic swimming occur due to overuse of the knee, shoulder, and lumbar spine, due to the nature of repetitive movements in training (2, 5). Likewise, since 2015, there has been a consensus on the recording of injuries in aquatic sports (6) that can help understand and control the epidemiology of injuries in artistic swimming. However, research on the prevalence of injuries in aquatic sports, such as swimming, has been quite precarious to date from a methodological point of view (7), which could also be re /uni FB02 ected in other aquatic disciplines, such as artistic swimming, making it dif /uni FB01 cult to apply effective preventive programs.

Poor biomechanics, especially with fatigue of scapular stabilizing and rotator cuff muscles, leads to dynamic instability and impingement . A multitude of issues contribute to the ' swimmer ' s shoulder ' : a hypermobile glenohumeral joint combined with technique flaws or fatigue can lead to impingement of the rotator cuff . Hypermobility can be multifactorial: the swimmer may have a predisposition with shoulder laxity or may have a traumatic event. Microtears or stretching of the glenohumeral ligaments exacerbate static instability. Once these athletes fatigue, their rotator cuff cannot alone stabilize the humerus and the increased translation, especially upward or superiorposterior leads to overloading the rotator cuff tendon. Abduction and rotation with humeral head translation can result in contact of the posterior supraspinatus or anterior infraspinatus against the posterior glenoid rim and labrum -a condition also described as ' internal impingement. ' Fortunately, most of these cases can be treated with rehabilitation and a proper strengthening routine as well as improvement in potential stroke flaws .

Content: Stroke errors are potential risk factors for shoulder pain in competitive swimmers. 4,8,14,15 Swimmers are subject to shoulder impingement for approximately 25% of their freestyle stroke cycle, even when using proper biomechanics. 16 The mechanics of these swimmers may be a result of instruction provided by their youth swimming coaches or a stroke technique developed throughout their careers. These findings highlight the importance of proper instruction on stroke technique in youth swimming. The swimming motion is complex, and faulty mechanics may develop because of poor coaching, poor understanding by the swimmer, shoulder pain, or performance factors. The biomechanical errors of a dropped elbow during the pull-through phase and a dropped elbow during the recovery phase were most prevalent. Dropping the elbow during the pull-through phase places the propulsive muscles of the shoulder at a mechanical disadvantage by placing the shoulder in a more externally rotated position. 7 This stroke error is commonly identified by swimming coaches and can result in shoulder external rotation with horizontal adduction, placing the shoulder in an impingement position. 15 During the above-water recovery phase, the elbow should be kept higher than the wrist and should avoid a dropped position. 2,14 A dropped elbow during this phase may orient the humerus more perpendicular to the water, producing a shorter arc of motion and decreasing time spent in the impinged position. 8 This stroke alteration is incorrect, but it may be an attempt to avoid the impingement position of shoulder flexion and internal rotation. 8 This error could be the consequence of pain and not the cause. An elbow that enters prior to the hand causes the water to exert an upward force on the dropped humerus, leading to superior translation of the humeral head and subacromial impingement. 14

For the 8-UN, I get in the water with them, have them in the face down streamline position,hold them at the hips.

Content: Acute Injuries Although most musculoskeletal problems in swimming are overuse injuries due to chronic overload, there are several acute types of injury that can occur in swimmers. Most truly acute injuries occur due to contact or direct trauma and are thus uncommon in a non-contact sport such as swimming. However, this can happen in swimming due to striking the hand on the wall at the finish of a sprint. Metacarpal fractures requiring surgery have occurred in elite-level swimmers. Hand and finger contusions and fractures may also occur by striking the hand on the lane line or by striking the hand of another swimmer. Foot injuries can occur from striking the foot on the wall during a flip turn. These mechanisms of injury can also lead to lacerations. Shoulder pain is common in swimming and is typically a chronic injury due to repetitive overuse. However, acute shoulder subluxation can occur in swimmers with underlying shoulder laxity. For example, the overhead position of the arm during hand entry in backstroke can predispose to shoulder subluxation [16, 17]. Swimmers often have some degree of underlying shoulder laxity, and this can predispose to acute subluxation. Patellar subluxation can occur in individuals with underlying generalized laxity and, although uncommon, can occur during breast stroke swimming . Acute meniscus tears are uncommon in swimming, but symptoms from a degenerative meniscus tear in an older athlete may be exacerbated by breaststroke swimming due to the forceful rotatory and valgus loads on the knee .

Content: Given these risk factors, structured injury prevention approaches are essential. Individualized training load management can mitigate cumulative stress, while stroke technique optimization may reduce joint strain. Targeted strength programs focusing on the shoulder, knee, and lumbar spine can enhance stability, and structured recovery protocols, including periodized rest and mobility exercises, may help to counteract fatigue and repetitive stress effects. To specifically address the FAT, training programs should integrate nutritional strategies to ensure adequate energy availability, menstrual health monitoring, and bone health assessments. Female swimmers at risk of FAT may benefit from adjusting their training loads during periods of low energy availability and implementing strength-based interventions to enhance bone mineral density and joint stability. Additionally, educational programs for athletes and coaches on the early detection of FAT symptoms could help to prevent long-term health consequences.

In swimming sports, where symmetrical or asymmetrical movement skates can be, too many physical and physiological needs (muscle strength, anaerobic power, neuromuscular skill and coordination, aesthetic and artistic movements and aerobic endurance) can cause serious injuries (Pyne &amp; Sharp, 2014). Athletes who display elite performance in this sport are people who started sports at the age of 7-8 and performed heavy training throughout their careers (Kammer et al., 1999). Apart from the injuries caused by physical and mental fatigue after continuous heavy training, many internal and external factors can actually affect as well. While some of the studies focused on poor swimming technique, flexibility or force imbalance other than fatigue, others dealt with the situation in psychological dimensions. One of the reasons why contradictory results are reported in the studies is that the specific movement patterns and physiological needs of the swimming branches are different and the injuries differ depending on these conditions (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012).

Content: The results indicate a relationship between dropped elbow during the recovery phase and a thumb-first hand entry angle as well as between a dropped elbow during recovery and an incorrect hand entry position. These findings suggest that a dropped elbow may lead to an improper entry position with the elbow entering before the hand. 14 During video grading, the swimming coach evaluators identified a discrepancy between the provided criteria and a poor freestyle stroke technique. While maintaining a 'straight back' pull-through during freestyle is considered safest for a swimmer's shoulder girdle because it avoids excessive horizontal adduction, coaches recognize an S-shaped pullthrough pattern (Figure 5b) produces performance gains and increased swimming velocity. 9 Utilizing a curvilinear motion during the freestyle pull-through best produces propulsion by constantly pushing water and gaining additional resistance rather than by pushing water, which has already been accelerated by a straight back stroke path. 2 While this method of underwater propulsion makes sense for performance purposes, it yields increased risk for the swimmer's shoulder in a vulnerable impingement position. This curvilinear motion mimics the faulty S-shaped pull-through pattern, which can give rise to increased time in the impingement position. It forces the shoulder to maintain increased muscle recruitment and higher loads over a longer period. 2,4,9,14,15

Content: 90 percent of swimming performance originates from the upper extremity, and almost all of these injuries occur in the shoulder area (Pink &amp; Tibone, 2000). In line with this inference, Weldon III &amp; Richardson, (2001) reported that 90 percent of the problems of swimmers who applied to a doctor with different complaints were shoulder-related. Especially professional athletes should take good care of themselves to avoid these injuries. During periods of heavy training, good rest and nutrition are the most important principles of protection from these injuries. Sufficient amounts of carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, protein to recover muscle damage, and vitamin-supplemented nutrition to replace lost minerals. In some cases, taking sports supplements under the supervision of an expert may be beneficial. Supplements are known to increase performance as well as prevent injuries (Tatlici &amp; Cakmakci, 2019). Another important measure is to keep the flexibility of the shoulder area at an optimum level (Beach, Whitney, &amp; Dickoff-Hoffman, 1992) . Imbalance in the shoulder muscles can lead to deterioration of posture, and postural deterioration can cause injury risks (Kluemper, Uhl, &amp; Hazelrigg, 2006). In this direction, both flexibility and strength should be exercised together with functional training. In free, butterfly and supine swimming performances, the swimmer manages the upper extremity strength by adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder, and this often causes agonist-antagonist force imbalance (Birrer, 1986).

Content: In addition it is very important to strengthen the shoulder area with rotator cuff exercises (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012). However, the right exercise choices should be made. Especially in free swimming, stroke strengthens the inner rotator muscles in the shoulder; In free swimmers, the inner rotator muscles are significantly stronger than the outer rotator muscles. Considering the role of strength imbalance in athlete injuries, it can be said that resistance training to strengthen the external rotator muscles of free swimmers can be beneficial. However, it is a fact that during swimming, muscle contractions and contraction rates will differ according to swimming style and this will result in different physiological adaptations (Unlu et al., 2019). Attractions of resistance training should be considered to be for the purpose of considering this matter. Apart from this, non-functional shoulder strength training may have some drawbacks. Exercises that increase shoulder range of motion and stabilize scapula are also beneficial. If machine strength training is to be done, there are some points to be considered technically. For example, the "pull-down" exercise is more functional compared to the "shoulder press" exercise in terms of strengthening the rotator cuff region muscles. However, in practice, the reel should be pulled towards the front of the chest, not towards the neck.

There are excellent articles and case reports that address clinical rehabilitation techniques but these are not the focus of this clinical commentary. 20,23-26 Attempts to replicate freestyle stroke technique using dry-land swimming benches have been found to recruit muscle in different patterns and may not replicate the swimming stroke ideally. 16,27 So, when working to correct a swimmer's stroke technique, it is best done in the water. Understanding the stroke mechanics and the drills that are commonly used by coaches in the swimming community to enhance stroke technique is important.

Content: Shoulder pain in swimmers has consistently been noted to interfere with swimming training and competition. In 1993, Mc Master and Troup published the first large scale United States survey documenting the prevalence of shoulder pain interfering with practice or competition to be 10-26% in a group of 1262 swimmers. 1 They also identified aspects of training that swimmers reported aggravated their pain, such as use of paddles, kickboards and stretching. Since that time, additional factors associated with shoulder pain and injury have been studied and the prevalence of shoulder pain in swimmers of varied ages and competitive levels has been well documented. 2,3 Given this high pain prevalence, it may not be surprising that a study of baseline shoulder function using the Kerlan-Jobe orthopedic clinic score reported that scores of NCAA swimmers are lower than those of athletes in other overhead sports, and are similar to injured athletes in other sports. 4 In addition, except for neurolysis for suprascapular neuropathy, arthroscopic surgery has had limited success in returning swimmers to prior competitive training volume and level. 5,6 Therefore, the mainstay of treatment for competitive swimmers is conservative management and Khodaee et al. report that most patients with shoulder pain shoulder cases can be treated with rehabilitation, a proper strengthening routine, and correction of stroke flaws. 7

Content: As soon as the athlete experiences increased pain, warm-up should be long and slow prior to training with intensity, distance, and frequency adjusted. Temporary avoidance of painful strokes or positions (typically, freestyle and butterfly) is recommended; absolute rest is rarely indicated because it often results in rapid deconditioning of the elite swimmer. 11 Hand paddles and pulling sets are discouraged because they stress on the shoulder and can exacerbate the injury. 30 A kickboard may be used with the elbows flexed to prevent shoulder impingement. This position may need to be modified to avoid forward shoulder elevation. Fins may also be used to maintain good body position while decreasing upper body stress. A pull buoy may change the position of the shoulder in the water and reduce drag. Athletes may tolerate breaststroke swimming without pain. Dry-land upper extremity weight training should be modified or eliminated. A strap around the upper arm over the biceps muscle (counterforce strap) may diminish the stress on the tendon. 36 The prevention strategy for knee pain in swimmers focuses on quadriceps strengthening (vastus medialis obliquus) and stretching. Hamstring stretching may also be advantageous. Athletes with inadequate hip internal rotation also benefit from flexibility exercises. 35 Butterfly swimmers require hip external rotators to power their kick from the gluteus medius and piriformis. During periods of relative rest, ice should be used judiciously and short courses (up to 1 week) of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication may be beneficial. Injection of corticosteroid into the subacromial bursa is a controversial option and should be limited to swimmers with constant pain.

It is a unique sport,in that it combines upper and lower extremity strength exercises with cardiovascular training in a non-weight bearing environment. Swimmers are unfortunately prone to injuries. Most swimming injuries are classed as overuse injuries and relate to faulty biomechanics. The most common swimming injury regions are the shoulder,neck, lower back and knee. Wanivenhaus et al (2012) highlighted in a study into epidemiology of swimming injuries that "An understanding of swimming biomechanics and typical injuries in swimming aids in the early recognition of injury, the initiation of treatment, and the design of optimal prevention and rehabilitation strategies." <!-- image --> Swimming overuse injuries usually arise from one or a combination of the below: - Poor stroke mechanics - Poor breathing technique - Poor flexibility or range of motion of neck or lower back - Hyper flexibility of joints with insufficient muscular stabilisation - Decreased rotator cuff or scapular muscle strength - Insufficient core strength/stability - Decreased hip muscle strength - Overtraining - Insufficient rest periods <!-- image --> Stretching is important for swimming because of the great range of muscles used when you're in the water. Unprepared muscles don't perform as well as muscles which have been warmed up ahead of exercising.

Content: This review confirms that the shoulder is the joint most frequently affected in swimmers, accounting for 39.04 1.95% of injuries across the analyzed studies . This aligns with findings by Sein et al. , where 91% of elite swimmers reported shoulder pain, and 69% of those undergoing imaging exhibited supraspinatus tendinopathy. The shoulder's biomechanical role in swimming, contributing to approximately 90% of forward propulsion , predisposes it to overuse injuries such as rotator cuff impingement, tendinitis, and instability . Repetitive overhead motions in swimming, combined with high training volumes, increase the injury risk . Moreover, factors such as muscular imbalances, excessive joint laxity, and poor technique further exacerbate the risk of shoulder injuries . Specific styles of swimming, such as freestyle and butterfly, involve extensive internal rotation and adduction of the shoulder, which increase strain on the rotator cuff . Differences in stroke mechanics, such as unilateral versus bilateral breathing, may create asymmetrical loading, increasing injury risk . These findings underscore the necessity of tailored preventive strategies. Effective interventions should focus on managing training loads, correcting stroke mechanics, and implementing shoulder-specific strength and mobility exercises. Such approaches are critical for minimizing overuse injuries and optimizing performance in competitive swimmers.

Nearly 90% of the forward propulsive power in swimming comes from the upper extremities, 24 explaining the cause of shoulder pain and injuries. In fact, the most common musculoskeletal complaint among swimmers is shoulder pain. 5 Richardson et al 25 showed that the incidence of shoulder pain was 52% of elite swimmers and 27% of nonelite swimmers. In Mc Master and Troup, 19 47% of 10- to 18-year-old swimmers, 66% of senior development swimmers, and 73% of elite swimmers reported a history of pain in the shoulders. The frequency of pain in both studies was highest for the elite swimmers, which may be due to increased training time and number of years of swimming. instability, impingement, labral tears, or symptomatic os acromiale). 5 Year-round swimmers average 6000 to 10 000 m (6500 to 11 000 yd) per day in practices. Practices are generally held 5 to 7 days per week, often twice a day, up to 3 times per week. This equates to roughly 60 000 to 80 000 m of total swimming distance per week. 4,12,25 With an average stroke count at 8 to 10 per 25 m, swimmers perform 30 000 rotations of each shoulder per week, placing tremendous stress on the shoulder girdle and glenohumeral joint. There is a paucity of biomechanical information on the swimming shoulder. The movements in swimming are closedchain mechanics, meaning that the distal segment (ie, the hand) is the relatively fixed segment, whereas the body is moved over the top of the hand. In swimming, 4 competitive strokes are used for training and racing purposes.

Content: Shoulder Rehabilitation Changes in training practices and improved research allow healthcare providers to manage shoulder pain in competitive swimmers better than ever before. In the past, the healthcare providers generally attributed shoulder pain to excessive training or too many repetitive overhead strokes leading to laxity and resultant impingement of the rotator cuff [33 -37]. Recently, a new treatment paradigm reveals no single cause for shoulder pain in swimmers but rather a cluster of contributing factors that can match the clinical presentation to the treatment . Edelman et al. offers a subclassification system for shoulder pain identifying a cluster of etiological factors: (1) predisposition, (2) fatigue, (3) injury-related (faulty) mechanics, and (4) tendinopathy . This model can guide the selection of homogenous subgroups for more effective treatment strategies as noted in Fig. 1.

Poor biomechanics, especially with fatigue of scapular stabilizing and rotator cuff muscles, leads to dynamic instability and impingement . A multitude of issues contribute to the ' swimmer ' s shoulder ' : a hypermobile glenohumeral joint combined with technique flaws or fatigue can lead to impingement of the rotator cuff . Hypermobility can be multifactorial: the swimmer may have a predisposition with shoulder laxity or may have a traumatic event. Microtears or stretching of the glenohumeral ligaments exacerbate static instability. Once these athletes fatigue, their rotator cuff cannot alone stabilize the humerus and the increased translation, especially upward or superiorposterior leads to overloading the rotator cuff tendon. Abduction and rotation with humeral head translation can result in contact of the posterior supraspinatus or anterior infraspinatus against the posterior glenoid rim and labrum -a condition also described as ' internal impingement. ' Fortunately, most of these cases can be treated with rehabilitation and a proper strengthening routine as well as improvement in potential stroke flaws .

Content: Some swimming activities consist repetitive movements (Costill 1992). Injuries in the swimming branch are seen at a low rate, but injuries in the swimming branch can take a long time and are exemplified by repetitive micro-traumas . Many injuries result from faulty techniques or mechanisms, and an assessment of the swimming biomechanics of any injured athlete should be performed to identify errors that may contribute to injury. Injuries in swimming should not only be taken into account by competitive swimmers, but also by the many recreational, master and fitness athletes who participate. Most injured swimmers are adults, bringing with them additional age-related factors that the junior competitor does not have that can contribute to injury. Injuries of swimmers should be considered not only while swimming, but also other factors in land training. Rest and other measures are taken to reduce the symptoms of injuries and increase injuries (Mc Master 1996). In free swimming style (crawl), different muscle contractions occur in each phase of the movement, and the repetition of these phases should be coordinated. These phases are; arm entry, reach forward, traction, traction mid phase, arm exit, and mid recovery (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 1). These phases need to be done continuously and with a specific technique (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 2). Technically, deterioration will increase the risk of injury, and working with more than 20% of the serratus anterior continuous maximum force, which is one of the major muscles in this swimming style, can also cause injuries (Ozyilmaz, 2018). Especially in long-lasting freestyle swimming performances, the decrease in the strength of this muscle due to fatigue causes the rhomboid muscles to work more (Pink et al., 2011). When the performance is long enough to cause fatigue in the rhomboid muscles, the shoulder area is particularly vulnerable and the risk of injury is greatly increased.

Content: The shoulder was the most commonly injured anatomic location, consistent with previous studies on collegiate swimmers and divers. 3,4,5,6 The proportion of shoulder injuries increased to an even greater degree in the swimmer-only subset (Table 2), as did the proportion of overuse injuries. Competitive swimmers perform 10 times the number of movements of other overhand athletes, 16 and may swim up to 9 miles per day at the elite level. 17 The biomechanics of frequent overhead motion involved in most swimming strokes also predispose swimmers to overuse-type shoulder injuries, often referred to as 'swimmer's shoulder'. 17 Injuries associated with freestyle and butterfly, two strokes that put the most overhead stress on the shoulder, 17,18 were also the most frequent in this population. Of note, it has been reported that swimmers aged 13-18 years believe mild to moderate shoulder pain should be tolerated to complete practice and many use pain medication to complete practice. 19 Such attitudes in adolescents are concerning and present important considerations for swim coaches and ATs in this age group. While our data do not directly examine the effects of sport specialization on injury prevalence, it is important that involved parties understand the potential risks of routine medication use during adolescence as well as the long-term consequences of 'playing through' their overuse injuries.

During the recovery phase, scapular retraction and elevation should be performed in combination with humeral abduction and external rotation movements (Ozyilmaz, 2018). In this style, the arms form the propulsion mechanism, and lower extremity injuries are very rare. The area that dominates the movement is the shoulder and 80% of injuries occur in this area. Similarly in breaststroke style, although the legs are more active than the arms, the shoulder area dominates the movement. The arms start and progress simultaneously with full flexion and internal rotation movement, and body movement is centered around the hip (Ozyilmaz, 2018). In the butterfly and supine styles, as in the free style, it is a bilateral activity, not in a reciprocal, unilateral pattern. In water diving, both shoulders are flexed, abduction and internal rotation, extension and recovery in the traction phase, while the arms are in abduction-internal rotation, and the arms are brought back to extension from the water (Ozyilmaz, 2018). As can be seen, in all swimming sports, varying degrees of internal and external rotation, scapular retraction and protraction shoulder movements cause injury, irritation, inflammation, rotator cuff tears-tendinitis, shoulder impingement syndromes, tears around the shoulder cartilage in that area (Ciullo and Stevens, 1989) (Figure 2).

Content: Freestyle (commonly known as 'crawl') and butterfly strokes pose the highest injury risks among swimming styles, primarily due to the repetitive arm abduction and the elevation above the head required by these techniques . The repetitive nature of these strokes places significant stress on the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers, often leading to fatigue, reduced dynamic stability, and impingement syndromes . The shoulder joint, which plays a crucial role in swimming, is characterized by its extensive range of motion and is supported by ligaments such as the glenohumeral and coracohumeral . Despite this support, muscular coordination is essential to maintaining joint stability. Research highlights the importance of shoulder range of motion (ROM), along with a balance between strength and flexibility, as deficits in these areas increase the risk of conditions such as scapular dyskinesis and 'swimmer's shoulder' . In contrast, breaststroke swimmers are more prone to knee injuries due to the valgus and rotational forces generated during the whip kick, commonly referred to as 'breaststroker's knee' . Both butterfly and breaststroke styles are also associated with an increased risk of lumbar spine injuries, as the hyperextension required to maintain a streamlined position places considerable load on the posterior structures of the lower back .

This is consistent with a previous study in which shoulder injury comprised 55% of swimming-related injuries but only 9% of cross-training injuries in collegiate female swimmers. 4 No such literature exists for men. There has been some implication that the shoulder is the body part that has the greatest incidence of injury in swimmers in general, although studies range from 3% to a high of 67%, and these were not specific for the collegiate level. 2,5 In the current study, the shoulder accounted for 36% of men's injuries and 50% of women's injuries suffered during practice. Shoulder injuries are likely reflective of the repetitive strain on the shoulders produced by swimming. We found that injury to the shoulder is the most frequent cause of injury and missed time. The shoulder also was the body part on which swimmers most commonly had surgery. Given these results, it seems reasonable to consider the development of preventive training programs focused on shoulder injuries. Back and neck injuries were also relatively frequent in our group.

This places tremendous stress on the shoulder girdle musculature and glenohumeral joint, and it is why shoulder pain is the most frequent musculoskeletal complaint among competitive swimmers. Evidence Acquisition: Articles were obtained through a variety of medical search sources, including Medline, Google Scholar, and review articles from 1980 through January 2010. Results: The most common cause of shoulder pain in swimmers is supraspinatus tendinopathy. Glenohumeral instability and labral tears have also been reported, but a paucity of information remains regarding prevalence and treatment in swimmers. Conclusion: Because of the great number of stroke repetitions and force generated through the upper extremity, the shoulder is uniquely vulnerable to injury in the competitive swimmer. Comprehensive evaluation should include the entire kinetic chain, including trunk strength and core stability. Keywords: swimmer's shoulder; swim strokes; biomechanics

Content: Florian Wanivenhaus, MD, Alice J. S. Fox, MSc, Salma Chaudhury, MD Ph D, and Scott A. Rodeo, MD Context: Competitive swimmers are predisposed to musculoskeletal injuries of the upper limb, knee, and spine. This review discusses the epidemiology of these injuries, in addition to prevention strategies that may assist the physician in formulating rehabilitation programs for the swimmer following an injury. Evidence Acquisition: A literature search was performed by a review of Google Scholar, OVID, and Pub Med articles published from 1972 to 2011. Results: This study highlights the epidemiology of injuries common to competitive swimmers and provides prevention strategies for the sports health professional. Conclusions: An understanding of swimming biomechanics and typical injuries in swimming aids in early recognition of injury, initiation of treatment, and design of optimal prevention and rehabilitation strategies. Keywords: competitive swimmer; injury; prevention; shoulder; knee; spine S wimming is a unique sport that combines upper and lower extremity strength exercises with cardiovascular training in a nonweightbearing environment. Four strokes are recognized in competitive swimming: freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, and breaststroke. Regardless of the stroke performed in competition, swimmers spend a considerable amount of their training time swimming freestyle. The highly repetitive motion that occurs in the normal swimming stroke can predispose elite swimmers to musculoskeletal injuries of the upper limb, knee, and spine. A 5-year survey from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revealed that overall elite swimmer injury rates were 4.00 injuries per 1000 hours training for men and 3.78 injuries per 1000 hours training for women. 49 Shoulder injuries are the most common injuries, with prevalence between 40% and 91%. 2,3,7,10,20,24,38,42

Content: It should also be recognized that there may be an acute exacerbation of an underlying chronic condition. For example, a swimmer with shoulder tendinopathy ( ' swimmers shoulder ' ) may have an acute exacerbation of shoulder pain due to a change in training volume or frequency [16, 17, 19]. A survey of injuries in a NCAA Division I collegiate swimming program reported that freshman had the highest rate of injury, supporting the relationship between a change in training and injury . A careful history is critical to determine if an apparently acute presentation of pain or injury is actually an exacerbation of a pre-existing problem. Acute exacerbation of a pre-existing, chronic injury is rather common. NCAA Division I collegiate swimming program found that 38 % of all injuries occurred during dryland training . Attention to technique and careful performance of dryland exercises is critical to prevent injury from these exercises. Relative rest of the irritated region and a focus on core strength and rehabilitation of supporting musculature is the key to treatment. Overuse Injuries Overuse injury risk in swimmers has been reported as high as 4.0 injuries per 1000 athletic exposure (AE) [16, 19 -22]. In a study of swimmers at the University of Iowa from 2002 to 2007, the shoulder and upper arm were the most commonly injured areas followed by the back and neck . In the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program study for a 4-year span, the rate of overuse injuries in men was 0.66 per 1000 AE and in women was 1.04 per 1000 AE . In a study of the 2009 FINA world championships, 171 injuries were reported (incidence of 66.0 per 1000 registered athletes) . The most affected body part was the shoulder and the most common cause of injury was overuse .

Content: Abstract: Swimming is a widely practiced sport with significant physical demands, placing athletes at a considerable risk of injury, particularly in the shoulder, due to repetitive high-intensity movements. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the patterns and frequency of injuries associated with swimming. Methods: A systematic search of the Web of Science, Pub Med, Scopus, and Sport Discus databases identified nine relevant studies. Results: The findings revealed a higher incidence of injuries in female swimmers compared to males, with the shoulder being the most frequently affected joint. This disparity is partially attributed to the Female Athlete Triad, a syndrome characterized by low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and poor bone health, which increases injury susceptibility. Other commonly affected regions include the knee, often associated with the biomechanical demands of breaststroke, and the lumbar spine, which is impacted by degenerative changes resulting from high training volumes. However, variability in the injury measurement protocols across studies limits their comparability and highlights the need for standardized methods. Conclusions: Based on these findings, professionals in the field can identify injury patterns to enhance diagnosis and treatment, design personalized prevention programs, implement early interventions, and innovate equipment and training methods to improve swimmer safety and performance.

Content: Swimming is a popular form of exercise both recreationally and competitively. A 2021 survey revealed that there were 2.8 million people aged six years and older competing on a swim team in the United States (US). 1 The non-weight bearing nature of the sport may lead people to believe that it is safe for joints. While this may be true for the recreational swimmer, elite swimmers may swim up to 14,000 meters and undergo 2,500 shoulder revolutions per day, 2 with competitive swimmers practicing five to seven days per week, sometimes twice daily. 3 It is therefore not surprising that shoulder pain is the most common orthopedic complaint in swimmers. A majority of high school competitive swimmers in one study believed that shoulder pain is normal, with 47% of this group reporting that they take pain medication regularly to manage their shoulder symptoms. 4 The most recent wide-scale study reporting the prevalence of shoulder pain in youth swimmers in the US was published by Mc Master and Troup in 1993, 5 who collected over 1,000 survey responses from swimmers aged 13-16 years who were selected for participation in USA Swimming-sponsored national training camps. The authors defined shoulder pain as pain that interfered with training or progress in training and reported that 9-26% of the swimmers were currently experiencing pain and 38-67% reported a history of shoulder pain. 5 Furthermore, the more years of competitive experience the swimmers had, the more likely they were to experience shoulder pain. 5 To date, there has not been another study from a diverse sample reporting on the prevalence of pain and disability in youth swimmers in the US, thereby accounting for possible changes in training over the past three decades.

Consequently, swimming was not exempt from injury risks, particularly overuse injuries affecting the shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle, and back . Among these, shoulder injuries were the most prevalent. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revealed that 34.7% of injuries in collegiate male swimmers and 36.8% in female swimmers involved the shoulder . Reported rates of shoulder injuries among competitive swimmers ranged from 40% to 91%, primarily due to repetitive overhead motions and the biomechanical demands of swimming . Furthermore, overuse and non-contact injuries were more frequent in women, with 63.7% of injuries reported compared to 44.4% in men . This difference was attributed to biomechanical factors, as female swimmers performed more arm revolutions per lap, thereby increasing their exposure to repetitive stress . At the elite level, swimmers trained up to 14.5 km per day, completing more than 2500 shoulder revolutions daily, which significantly elevated their risk of musculoskeletal injuries .

Content: Shoulder Stretching and Dynamic Warm-Up The shoulder is the most frequently stretched joint among swimmers. To date, swimmers have adopted stretches that target the static stabilizers of the GHJ. In the past, static stretches and pre-race rituals (i.e., ballistic windmill motion) were utilized in hopes of preventing injury . Recent research on swimmer ' s flexibility suggests there is no indication that extraordinary shoulder joint motion or flexibility is necessary to achieve a fast, efficient stroke [39, 40]. In addition, there is no evidence that static stretching immediately before activity will reduce muscle injury rates [41, 42]. Many swimmers are generally flexible and possess loose connective tissue (general joint laxity) . Because of their inherent laxity, swimmers should emphasize preserving the overall stability of the shoulder and less time on general static stretches . Instead, a dynamic warm-up (Fig. 2) has been found to produce short-term and long-term performance enhancements in power, agility, strength, muscle endurance, and anaerobic capacity [26, 38, 44, 45]. A dynamic warm-up tends to include some form of dynamic stretching, agility, and plyometric activities and specific motor pattern movements . Figure 2 demonstrates dynamic warm-up which is specifically designed for the swimming population. Swimmers should employ a steady pace with each activity and avoid ballistic type motions.

Content: Mc Kenzie et al. synthesized the findings from 22 studies on shoulder pain in competitive swimmers, highlighting the moderate evidence that associated competitive level training and altered muscle recruitment with pain, while factors such as range of motion and training frequency showed no significant association. Similarly, Hill et al. reviewed 29 studies to assess the risk factors for shoulder pain and injury, identifying clinical joint laxity, internal/external rotation, previous pain history, and competitive level training as moderately certain contributors, though no factors were deemed highly certain. These findings aligned with Barry et al. , who found no direct link between training load and pain, but suggested a potential connection to injuries and illnesses, while also emphasizing the methodological limitations. Additionally, Trinidad et al. reported a higher injury incidence in female swimmers due to anatomical, biomechanical, physiological, and psychological factors, while Tate et al. observed improvements in posterior shoulder endurance alongside reductions in disability with increased training load, albeit with decreases in internal rotation and horizontal adduction, which predisposed swimmers to overuse injuries. Despite extensive research on swimming injuries, systematic analyses of injury patterns and frequencies in regions beyond the shoulder, such as the knee and lumbar spine, remain scarce. Moreover, variability across swimming styles, competitive levels, and populations, along with the impact of specific training practices and equipment use, still require further investigation. Addressing these gaps could provide critical insights to improve injury prevention and management in swimming. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the patterns and frequency of injuries associated with swimming. The findings could provide valuable insights to support injury prevention strategies and improve the overall health and performance of swimmers.

We found a larger number of injuries in early eligibility years for both male and especially female swimmers. The shoulder was the most commonly involved body part. We feel there are 2 areas where swimming injury prevention could be attempted. First, the incorporation of freshman swimmers into collegiate training programs should be carefully monitored. Those freshman swimmers who are unaccustomed to significant cross-training activities or collegiate level yardage appear to be prone to injury. Training regimen adjustment and close assessment of freshmen athletes for signs of overuse injury may decrease injury occurrence and time missed. Secondly, our data suggest that injury prevention should focus on the shoulder for in-pool activities and the axial spine for cross-training and strength activities. 2042 Wolf et al

Content: In order to provide appropriate rehabilitation, knowledge of the factors associated with shoulder pain and injury is important for health care providers treating competitive swimmers. Both intrinsic and extrinsic variables have been cited in etiology of shoulder pathology. Extrinsic variables include number of years of swum 4,8 prior history of shoulder pain or injury, 3,9,10 and training variables, 8,10 such as acute:chronic workload ratio, which is calculated using the current training volume in relation to the rolling average of the volume of training over the prior four weeks. 11-13 A recent systematic review explored the impact of swim volume on various age competition levels and determined that adolescent swimmers experienced the highest level of shoulder pain although adult swimmers had a comparatively higher swim volume. 14 Intrinsic factors are specific to the individual swimmer, such as stroke technique, muscle force capacity and endurance, posture and mobility, and, if appropriately identified, may be amenable to change. 15 Although stroke characteristics, such as hand entry crossover during freestyle swimming, have been associated with shoul- der pain, the videotaping and complex stroke analysis techniques used by researchers may preclude their use in clinical practice. 11,12,16 The identification of clinical measures that assess possible contributors to shoulder pain in competitive swimmers is within the scope and ability of most clinicians. While authors have examined which clinical examination findings are related to pain and injury in the swimmers' shoulder, no systematic review has examined these tools in various age-group and competition levels. Changes in mobility and strength in the musculoskeletal system are inevitable across the lifespan; thus, it is reasonable to expect that risk factors for developing shoulder pain may change over time

Content: Abstract: Swimmer's shoulder is a common condition among elite swimmers, often leading to pain and reduced performance. Fatigue can exacerbate this condition by affecting shoulder strength, proprioception, and range of motion, potentially increasing the risk of overuse injuries. This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the impact of physiotherapy treatment and the effects of fatigue on shoulder kinematics using inertial and magnetic measurement units (IMUs). Five male swimmers (aged 21-27) with at least 3 years of training and suffering from swimmer's shoulder pain participated in the study. The protocol included three sessions: dry front crawl exercises using one arm in the first and third sessions, and a fatiguing swimming exercise in the second. IMUs were used to capture 3D rotation angles, focusing on flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotations during the first and third sessions. Stroke amplitude was analyzed before and after the physiotherapy treatment and fatiguing exercise. The results showed a significant increase in internal/external rotation amplitude post-fatigue before physiotherapy ( p = 0.03), with a non-significant decrease in flexion/extension after treatment, suggesting improved shoulder stabilization. Despite these preliminary findings being based on a reduced number of participants, they indicate that physiotherapy may enhance shoulder motion control in swimmers with shoulder pain. Nevertheless, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these results. Keywords: inertial sensors; shoulder kinematic; swimming; physiotherapy

Content: Studies have shown that shoulder injuries are inevitable in elite performance, regardless of young or adult swimmers (Kammer et al., 1999). Impingement is the leading cause of these injuries. It occurs when the pinching tendons rub against the acromion located on the roof of the shoulder joint. Most elite swimmers experience the impingement syndrome also known as "swimmer shoulder". Although it is common in all sports branches such as basketball, volleyball, handball and water polo, it is mostly seen in swimmers. In this syndrome, inflammation occurs in the tendons (tendinitis) and severe pain may also be centered on the neck or waist outside the shoulder. It is possible to be protected from this syndrome depending on many factors. The most important of these is to make stretching movements. However, there are factors that need to be considered while performing the movements, and the practices may differ from person to person. Stretching applications should be done in the same proportions to the back and front capsules. Greipp (1985) showed that shoulder pain will increase in cases of bad flexibility in the anterior shoulder region. However, keeping this flexibility at an optimum level is especially important for swimmers who are genetically prone to these injuries (Johnson et al., 1987).4

Content: While the shoulder remains the most injured region among swimmers, this review also underscores the knee and lumbar spine as prevalent sites of injury. Degenerative meniscal tears were the most frequently reported knee injury, accounting for 16.50 0.83% of cases . These injuries are often linked to the biomechanical demands of the breaststroke, which impose rotational and valgus stresses on the knee joint . Such findings align with the work of Salerno et al. , who emphasized that the repetitive nature of the breaststroke kick, particularly when performed with improper technique or high intensity, amplifies knee joint stress and predisposes swimmers to overuse injuries. Regarding the lumbar spine, this review identified a high prevalence of disc degeneration, being reported in 68% of elite swimmers compared to 29% of recreational swimmers . This disparity reinforces the influence of training intensity, duration, and cumulative load on spinal health. Previous studies attributed lumbar spine degeneration to the hyperextension and rotation required to maintain a streamlined body position, particularly in strokes such as butterfly and freestyle . Butterfly and freestyle strokes place high stress on the lumbar spine because of the required hyperextension and rotation. Additionally, repeated flip turns and wall push-offs contribute to cumulative spinal load, increasing the risk of chronic pain and degenerative changes . These findings underscore the necessity of targeted injury prevention strategies. For the knee, emphasis should be placed on optimizing breaststroke technique, improving lower limb strength, and reducing valgus stress through specific conditioning programs. For the lumbar spine, incorporating core stabilization exercises, monitoring training volume, and ensuring adequate recovery are critical to mitigating injury risks in competitive swimmers, especially those exposed to prolonged and intense training loads.

Content: The painful swimmer's shoulder should be considered in the context of the entire kinetic chain. This approach allows identification of a weak link, which may contribute to the functional problem. For example, a proximal muscle weakness may put extra stress on a distal joint, which often results in dysfunction, pain, or injury. Sciascia 27 coined this phenomenon catch up : 'changes in interactive moments altering forces on distal segments.' Whereas the functional manifestation may present as shoulder pain, the underlying cause may be periscapular muscle fatigue or core weakness. The relationship between the function of the shoulder girdle and the rest of the body is well recognized in throwing athletes 8,17 and is relevant to the successful treatment of shoulder pain in swimmers. The avoidance of impingement through neuromuscular activation, prevention of superior humeral migration, proximal muscle coordination, and strength or by cessation of the activity before fatigue becomes crucial in managing pain and protecting the rotator cuff.

Content: <!-- image --> Shoulder pain is the most frequent orthopaedic injury in swimmers, with a reported prevalence between 40% and 91% in elite swimmers. Swimmer's shoulder is a condition with a gradual onset due to repetitive activity and can be classified as microtrauma. Swimmer's shoulder usually presents as subacromial impingement involving the rotator cuff tendon, bicipital tendon, or subacromial bursa. Primary subacromial impingement involves compression of these structures between the acromion and greater tuberosity (due to usually a tight posterior capsule causing the humeral head to migrate anteriorly) or abnormal acromial morphology. However, primary impingement syndrome is less common in competitive swimmers than secondary impingement. Secondary impingement occurs through a series of impairments, usually in a swimmer with increased anterior glenohumeral laxity (shoulder ROM in swimmers often exhibit excessive external rotation and limited internal rotation). This shift in ROM towards increased external rotation is an adjustment to the demands on the glenohumeral joint allowing anterior laxity and greater demand on the rotator cuff and the long head of the biceps to reduce humeral head elevation and anterior translation. Chronic swimmer's shoulder can result in pathology of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum, and long head of the biceps.

Content: The increased injury risk in female swimmers is influenced by multiple factors, including biomechanics, training load, and competition level. Shorter limb lengths in female swimmers result in a higher stroke count per distance, increasing joint stress and the likelihood of overuse injuries . Additionally, lower muscular strength and altered movement patterns place greater strain on the shoulder, which endures continuous cyclical loading during swimming . The level of competition significantly influences the injury prevalence and anatomical distribution. Elite swimmers exhibit the highest injury rates, particularly shoulder tendinitis, impingement, and knee injuries, primarily due to higher training volumes and repetitive overhead motions . Trained (non-elite) swimmers also experience frequent shoulder and knee injuries; however, their injuries are more often related to joint inflammation and cumulative overuse rather than acute damage . In contrast, recreational swimmers present a lower overall injury prevalence, though shoulder impingement and tendinitis remain common . Additionally, elite swimmers show a higher prevalence of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine compared to recreational athletes, reinforcing the long-term impact of high training loads . Improper training load management-both excessive and insufficient-can increase the injury risk by disrupting the balance between stress and recovery . High-intensity periods, particularly during competitions, may expose female swimmers to greater risks due to cumulative fatigue and hormonal fluctuations, which can compromise joint stability and neuromuscular control . Additionally, repetitive movements, including shoulder rotations, turns, and push-offs, contribute to progressive tissue strain.

Content: The primary finding of this review is the higher incidence of injuries in female swimmers compared to male swimmers, with the shoulder being the most affected joint. This aligns with the findings of De Almeida et al. , who reported shoulder injuries in 48% of female swimmers compared to 41.4% of males. Several factors, including physiological and hormonal differences, contribute to this discrepancy. The prevalence of the Female Athlete Triad (FAT), which is characterized by low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and poor bone health, is a significant risk factor . Up to 47% of female swimmers exhibit all three components of FAT , which triples their risk of stress fractures compared to athletes without this condition . Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle further exacerbate this risk by temporarily affecting muscle strength, joint stability, and neuromuscular control .

Content: Abstract: Swimming is a widely practiced sport with significant physical demands, placing athletes at a considerable risk of injury, particularly in the shoulder, due to repetitive high-intensity movements. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the patterns and frequency of injuries associated with swimming. Methods: A systematic search of the Web of Science, Pub Med, Scopus, and Sport Discus databases identified nine relevant studies. Results: The findings revealed a higher incidence of injuries in female swimmers compared to males, with the shoulder being the most frequently affected joint. This disparity is partially attributed to the Female Athlete Triad, a syndrome characterized by low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and poor bone health, which increases injury susceptibility. Other commonly affected regions include the knee, often associated with the biomechanical demands of breaststroke, and the lumbar spine, which is impacted by degenerative changes resulting from high training volumes. However, variability in the injury measurement protocols across studies limits their comparability and highlights the need for standardized methods. Conclusions: Based on these findings, professionals in the field can identify injury patterns to enhance diagnosis and treatment, design personalized prevention programs, implement early interventions, and innovate equipment and training methods to improve swimmer safety and performance.

Content: This study reveals elevated injury rates among adolescent female swimmers and divers compared to their male counterparts, consistent with similar findings in the collegiate population. It also provides data demonstrating anatomic injury patterns among swimmers and divers separately; however, given the limitations of the subset analyses as discussed above, further studies are warranted to better characterize swimming and diving injuries in this vulnerable age group. Currently, there is no standardized injury-related education for USA Swimming coaches of athletes at this age. 30 Given the results of this study, high school swimming and diving coaches and ATs may consider sport-specific and gender-specific risk factors when working with their adolescent athletes to prevent injury. For example, coaches may consider adjusting training plans for female freestyle and butterfly swimmers to include a higher volume of shoulder injury prevention exercises out of the water. Likewise, diving coaches should keep in mind the increased risk of impact-related injuries, and work on developing strategies to mitigate this when teaching the mechanics of specific dives. In summary, further research in gender specific injury prevention is needed to develop stronger evidence-based, targeted injury prevention programs in high school swimming and diving.

Content: In summary, we found interesting injury information regarding a previously poorly understood group: collegiate swimmers. Injury patterns for men and women largely were similar in scope. We found a larger number of injuries in early eligibility years for both male and especially female swimmers. The shoulder was the most commonly involved body part. We feel there are 2 areas where swimming injury prevention could be attempted. First, the incorporation of freshman swimmers into collegiate training programs should be carefully monitored. Those freshman swimmers who are unaccustomed to significant cross-training activities or collegiate level yardage appear to be prone to injury. Training regimen adjustment and close assessment of freshmen athletes for signs of overuse injury may decrease injury occurrence and time missed. Secondly, our data suggest that injury prevention should focus on the shoulder for in-pool activities and the axial spine for cross-training and strength activities. 2042 Wolf et al

Content: Florian Wanivenhaus, MD, Alice J. S. Fox, MSc, Salma Chaudhury, MD Ph D, and Scott A. Rodeo, MD Context: Competitive swimmers are predisposed to musculoskeletal injuries of the upper limb, knee, and spine. This review discusses the epidemiology of these injuries, in addition to prevention strategies that may assist the physician in formulating rehabilitation programs for the swimmer following an injury. Evidence Acquisition: A literature search was performed by a review of Google Scholar, OVID, and Pub Med articles published from 1972 to 2011. Results: This study highlights the epidemiology of injuries common to competitive swimmers and provides prevention strategies for the sports health professional. Conclusions: An understanding of swimming biomechanics and typical injuries in swimming aids in early recognition of injury, initiation of treatment, and design of optimal prevention and rehabilitation strategies. Keywords: competitive swimmer; injury; prevention; shoulder; knee; spine S wimming is a unique sport that combines upper and lower extremity strength exercises with cardiovascular training in a nonweightbearing environment. Four strokes are recognized in competitive swimming: freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, and breaststroke. Regardless of the stroke performed in competition, swimmers spend a considerable amount of their training time swimming freestyle. The highly repetitive motion that occurs in the normal swimming stroke can predispose elite swimmers to musculoskeletal injuries of the upper limb, knee, and spine. A 5-year survey from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revealed that overall elite swimmer injury rates were 4.00 injuries per 1000 hours training for men and 3.78 injuries per 1000 hours training for women. 49 Shoulder injuries are the most common injuries, with prevalence between 40% and 91%. 2,3,7,10,20,24,38,42

Content: Not surprisingly, practice was the most common activity that led to injury, accounting for nearly 60% of injuries. Approximately 38% of injuries in this study resulted from team activities out of the pool, including strength training and dry-land workouts. This is similar to what was reported by Mc Farland and Wasik, 4 who found that 44% of all injuries were caused by cross-training in a cohort of collegiate female swimmers. Cross-training is thought to be additive to an athlete's overall fitness and a way to enhance a swimmer's ability to compete. It is impossible to assess from our data how many injuries may have been prevented or how much swimming performance was enhanced by crosstraining. Yet, swimmers are often not accustomed to the particulars of nonswimming workouts, and this may explain our high incidence of out-of-pool injuries. Our results suggest that these programs need to be scrutinized closely given that nearly 40% of injuries continue to occur out of the pool. The cost/benefit ratio for cross-training and related injuries may be reason to alter some out-of-pool training activities. Overall, although our results show that collegiate swimming has a low injury per exposure rate, there can still be important time loss resulting from such occurrences. We found an injury rate of 4.0 and 3.78 per 1000 exposures for men and women, respectively. Mc Farland and Wasik 4 previously had found an injury rate of 2.12 per 1000 exposures for a collegiate female cohort. This increase in the number of injuries suffered by collegiate swimmers likely reflects the trend that is occurring with all sports in which intensive training persists essentially all year, even in the outof-season months.

Content: This review underscores the high prevalence of injuries in swimmers, with the shoulder being the most frequently affected joint due to the biomechanical and physiological demands of the sport. Female swimmers show a disproportionately higher injury incidence, likely influenced by hormonal and biomechanical factors, as well as the FAT, which exacerbates injury risks. Additionally, the knee and lumbar spine emerge as critical injury sites, particularly in specialized strokes like breaststroke, which impose unique mechanical stresses. Despite these findings, the lack of standardized injury measurement protocols and the variability in data reporting across studies hinder the comparability and generalizability of results. Future research should prioritize the implementation of unified injury surveillance frameworks and explore the integration of advanced technologies, such as wearable sensors and real-time tracking systems. These steps will provide deeper insights into injury mechanisms, facilitate the development of tailored preventive strategies, and ultimately contribute to enhancing the health, safety, and performance of swimmers across all levels.

Content: The results of this study provide several interesting findings. There were no significant differences in the number of injuries per team-related exposures when comparing injuries by gender. In addition, similar injury patterns were seen between genders in terms of stroke specialty, position, and activities during which an injury occurred. Injuries and time missed related to injury were similar The relationship of injury and year of college eligibility was a remarkable finding in this group of swimmers. The highest total number of injuries and the highest mean number of injuries per swimmer occurred during the freshman year of eligibility. Both genders demonstrated a general decrease in the number of injuries and injury rates after the freshman season. This decrease was more gradual in the men's team and more dramatic for the women's team. In addition, we also found a significant decrease in the risk of suffering an injury with later years of eligibility. The high prevalence of injuries during the early college years is likely explained by the transition from high school training regimens to that of the collegiate level. The yardage required of college swimmers and additional cross-training activities are often substantially greater than what an athlete was accustomed to in high school and club swimming. This can lead to overuse-type injuries early in a swimmer's college career. As the swimmers become accustomed to the yardage and workout routine, fewer injuries are incurred. A second possible explanation for fewer injuries after the freshman season is that frequently injured freshman swimmers may subsequently decide to no longer swim. We did not find this to be the case in our group of swimmers. One athlete discontinued swimming secondary to medical issues, but this occurred following the sophomore season.

Content: To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the epidemiology of injuries in US high school swimmers and divers using data captured by a large, longitudinal national surveillance system. These data build a strong foundation on which to build greater understanding of injuries in adolescent swimmers and divers, with a few particularly notable findings. First, this study demonstrated a lower overall injury rate (0.26 per 1000 AE) when compared to NCAA swimmers and divers (1.87 per 1000 AE). 3 This may be due to less practice exposure at a lower level of competition. Additionally, females consistently had significantly higher injury rates per exposure than males in all categories (overall, practice, and competition). This supports existing research on college swimming and diving injuries that has found a higher overall injury rate in female compared to male collegiate swimmers and divers, 5,8 and suggests that females may be at a higher risk for injury relative to males in the adolescent population as well. In contrast to previous studies, 5,15 however, there was no significant difference in the proportion of overuse injuries in girls and boys.

The overall injury rates were estimated as 4.00 injuries per 1000 exposures for men and 3.78 injuries per 1000 exposures for women. Thirty-seven percent of injuries resulted in missed time. The shoulder/upper arm was the most frequently injured body part followed by the neck/back. Freshman swimmers suffered the most injuries as well as the highest mean number of injuries per swimmer. A significant pattern of fewer injuries in later years of eligibility was also demonstrated. The relative risk (RR) for injury was higher among nonfreestyle stroke specialties (RR, 1.33 [1.00-1.77]). Injury most often occurred as a result of, or during, practice for all swimmers. However, 38% of injuries were the result of team activities outside of practice or competition, such as strength training. No significant relationship was found between occurrence of injury and gender or scholarship status. There was no significant relationship between body part injured and stroke specialty. An increased number of total injuries and an increased risk of injuries in freshman collegiate swimmers were found. Conclusion: Particular attention should be given to swimmers making the transition into collegiate level swimming. These data also suggest that injury surveillance and potential prevention strategies should focus on the shoulder for in-pool activities and the axial spine for cross-training activities.

Content: 90 percent of swimming performance originates from the upper extremity, and almost all of these injuries occur in the shoulder area (Pink &amp; Tibone, 2000). In line with this inference, Weldon III &amp; Richardson, (2001) reported that 90 percent of the problems of swimmers who applied to a doctor with different complaints were shoulder-related. Especially professional athletes should take good care of themselves to avoid these injuries. During periods of heavy training, good rest and nutrition are the most important principles of protection from these injuries. Sufficient amounts of carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, protein to recover muscle damage, and vitamin-supplemented nutrition to replace lost minerals. In some cases, taking sports supplements under the supervision of an expert may be beneficial. Supplements are known to increase performance as well as prevent injuries (Tatlici &amp; Cakmakci, 2019). Another important measure is to keep the flexibility of the shoulder area at an optimum level (Beach, Whitney, &amp; Dickoff-Hoffman, 1992) . Imbalance in the shoulder muscles can lead to deterioration of posture, and postural deterioration can cause injury risks (Kluemper, Uhl, &amp; Hazelrigg, 2006). In this direction, both flexibility and strength should be exercised together with functional training. In free, butterfly and supine swimming performances, the swimmer manages the upper extremity strength by adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder, and this often causes agonist-antagonist force imbalance (Birrer, 1986). Pink &amp; Tibone, (2000) reported in their study that adduction-abduction force imbalances in the shoulder were 2.05: 1 in swimmers and 1.53: 1 in non-swimmers

Content: Mc Kenzie et al. synthesized the findings from 22 studies on shoulder pain in competitive swimmers, highlighting the moderate evidence that associated competitive level training and altered muscle recruitment with pain, while factors such as range of motion and training frequency showed no significant association. Similarly, Hill et al. reviewed 29 studies to assess the risk factors for shoulder pain and injury, identifying clinical joint laxity, internal/external rotation, previous pain history, and competitive level training as moderately certain contributors, though no factors were deemed highly certain. These findings aligned with Barry et al. , who found no direct link between training load and pain, but suggested a potential connection to injuries and illnesses, while also emphasizing the methodological limitations. Additionally, Trinidad et al. reported a higher injury incidence in female swimmers due to anatomical, biomechanical, physiological, and psychological factors, while Tate et al. observed improvements in posterior shoulder endurance alongside reductions in disability with increased training load, albeit with decreases in internal rotation and horizontal adduction, which predisposed swimmers to overuse injuries. Despite extensive research on swimming injuries, systematic analyses of injury patterns and frequencies in regions beyond the shoulder, such as the knee and lumbar spine, remain scarce. Moreover, variability across swimming styles, competitive levels, and populations, along with the impact of specific training practices and equipment use, still require further investigation. Addressing these gaps could provide critical insights to improve injury prevention and management in swimming.

Content: Our results show that the shoulder was the most frequently injured body part. This is consistent with a previous study in which shoulder injury comprised 55% of swimming-related injuries but only 9% of cross-training injuries in collegiate female swimmers. 4 No such literature exists for men. There has been some implication that the shoulder is the body part that has the greatest incidence of injury in swimmers in general, although studies range from 3% to a high of 67%, and these were not specific for the collegiate level. 2,5 In the current study, the shoulder accounted for 36% of men's injuries and 50% of women's injuries suffered during practice. Shoulder injuries are likely reflective of the repetitive strain on the shoulders produced by swimming. We found that injury to the shoulder is the most frequent cause of injury and missed time. The shoulder also was the body part on which swimmers most commonly had surgery. Given these results, it seems reasonable to consider the development of preventive training programs focused on shoulder injuries. Back and neck injuries were also relatively frequent in our group. However, these injuries were most commonly associated with crosstraining activities.

Content: Objective: Using data from a longitudinal national sports injury surveillance program, this study aimed to calculate injury rates and describe injury patterns across high school swimmers and divers. Design: Descriptive Epidemiological Study. Athletic trainers (ATs) from participating high schools reported injuries from swimming and diving programs for the High School Reporting Information Online system. Setting: Convenience sample of high school boys and girls swimming and diving injuries during the 2008-2019 school years. Patients or other Participants: High school boys and girls swimmers and divers (aged ~1418 years). Independent Variables: Exposure data on gender, location of injury (practice versus competition), mechanism of injury, and sport (swimming versus diving). Main Outcome Measures: Injury rates, rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and other descriptive statistics were performed. Results: 563 swimming and diving injuries occurred during 2,171,260 athlete exposures (0.26 per 1000 athlete exposures). Girls had higher injury rates than boys overall (rate ratio (RR) 1.57, p &lt; 0.05), in practice (RR 1.53, p &lt; 0.05), and competition (RR 1.81, p &lt; 0.05). In swimmers, most injuries were to the shoulder (48.6%), associated with the freestyle (67.3%), and classified as overuse/chronic (58.0%). Amongst divers, most injuries were to the head/face (36.6%) and from contact with the playing surface (68.3%). Conclusions: Girls had statistically significantly higher injury rates than boys. The shoulder and head/face were the most injured body parts in swimmers and divers, respectively. Swimming injuries were most frequently of an overuse etiology, while diving injuries were more likely traumatic. Coaches and ATs should be aware of these findings to develop targeted strategies for injury prevention.

Content: Some swimming activities consist repetitive movements (Costill 1992). Injuries in the swimming branch are seen at a low rate, but injuries in the swimming branch can take a long time and are exemplified by repetitive micro-traumas . Many injuries result from faulty techniques or mechanisms, and an assessment of the swimming biomechanics of any injured athlete should be performed to identify errors that may contribute to injury. Injuries in swimming should not only be taken into account by competitive swimmers, but also by the many recreational, master and fitness athletes who participate. Most injured swimmers are adults, bringing with them additional age-related factors that the junior competitor does not have that can contribute to injury. Injuries of swimmers should be considered not only while swimming, but also other factors in land training. Rest and other measures are taken to reduce the symptoms of injuries and increase injuries (Mc Master 1996). In free swimming style (crawl), different muscle contractions occur in each phase of the movement, and the repetition of these phases should be coordinated. These phases are; arm entry, reach forward, traction, traction mid phase, arm exit, and mid recovery (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 1). These phases need to be done continuously and with a specific technique (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 2). Technically, deterioration will increase the risk of injury, and working with more than 20% of the serratus anterior continuous maximum force, which is one of the major muscles in this swimming style, can also cause injuries (Ozyilmaz, 2018). Especially in long-lasting freestyle swimming performances, the decrease in the strength of this muscle due to fatigue causes the rhomboid muscles to work more (Pink et al., 2011). When the performance is long enough to cause fatigue in the rhomboid muscles, the shoulder area is particularly vulnerable and the risk of injury is greatly increased.

Content: Given these risk factors, structured injury prevention approaches are essential. Individualized training load management can mitigate cumulative stress, while stroke technique optimization may reduce joint strain. Targeted strength programs focusing on the shoulder, knee, and lumbar spine can enhance stability, and structured recovery protocols, including periodized rest and mobility exercises, may help to counteract fatigue and repetitive stress effects. To specifically address the FAT, training programs should integrate nutritional strategies to ensure adequate energy availability, menstrual health monitoring, and bone health assessments. Female swimmers at risk of FAT may benefit from adjusting their training loads during periods of low energy availability and implementing strength-based interventions to enhance bone mineral density and joint stability. Additionally, educational programs for athletes and coaches on the early detection of FAT symptoms could help to prevent long-term health consequences.

Content: Since elite athletes do heavy training to keep their performance at the top level, for example in wrestling (Halloran, 2008; Tatlici et al., 2021), boxing (Loosemore et al., 2015; Tatlici et al., 2022), football (Koutures et al., 2010) injuries are inevitable. In swimming sports, where symmetrical or asymmetrical movement skates can be, too many physical and physiological needs (muscle strength, anaerobic power, neuromuscular skill and coordination, aesthetic and artistic movements and aerobic endurance) can cause serious injuries (Pyne &amp; Sharp, 2014). Athletes who display elite performance in this sport are people who started sports at the age of 7-8 and performed heavy training throughout their careers (Kammer et al., 1999). Apart from the injuries caused by physical and mental fatigue after continuous heavy training, many internal and external factors can actually affect as well. While some of the studies focused on poor swimming technique, flexibility or force imbalance other than fatigue, others dealt with the situation in psychological dimensions. One of the reasons why contradictory results are reported in the studies is that the specific movement patterns and physiological needs of the swimming branches are different and the injuries differ depending on these conditions (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012).

Content: While the shoulder remains the most injured region among swimmers, this review also underscores the knee and lumbar spine as prevalent sites of injury. Degenerative meniscal tears were the most frequently reported knee injury, accounting for 16.50 0.83% of cases . These injuries are often linked to the biomechanical demands of the breaststroke, which impose rotational and valgus stresses on the knee joint . Such findings align with the work of Salerno et al. , who emphasized that the repetitive nature of the breaststroke kick, particularly when performed with improper technique or high intensity, amplifies knee joint stress and predisposes swimmers to overuse injuries. Regarding the lumbar spine, this review identified a high prevalence of disc degeneration, being reported in 68% of elite swimmers compared to 29% of recreational swimmers . This disparity reinforces the influence of training intensity, duration, and cumulative load on spinal health. Previous studies attributed lumbar spine degeneration to the hyperextension and rotation required to maintain a streamlined body position, particularly in strokes such as butterfly and freestyle . Butterfly and freestyle strokes place high stress on the lumbar spine because of the required hyperextension and rotation. Additionally, repeated flip turns and wall push-offs contribute to cumulative spinal load, increasing the risk of chronic pain and degenerative changes . These findings underscore the necessity of targeted injury prevention strategies. For the knee, emphasis should be placed on optimizing breaststroke technique, improving lower limb strength, and reducing valgus stress through specific conditioning programs. For the lumbar spine, incorporating core stabilization exercises, monitoring training volume, and ensuring adequate recovery are critical to mitigating injury risks in competitive swimmers, especially those exposed to prolonged and intense training loads.

Content: Acute Injuries Although most musculoskeletal problems in swimming are overuse injuries due to chronic overload, there are several acute types of injury that can occur in swimmers. Most truly acute injuries occur due to contact or direct trauma and are thus uncommon in a non-contact sport such as swimming. However, this can happen in swimming due to striking the hand on the wall at the finish of a sprint. Metacarpal fractures requiring surgery have occurred in elite-level swimmers. Hand and finger contusions and fractures may also occur by striking the hand on the lane line or by striking the hand of another swimmer. Foot injuries can occur from striking the foot on the wall during a flip turn. These mechanisms of injury can also lead to lacerations. Shoulder pain is common in swimming and is typically a chronic injury due to repetitive overuse. However, acute shoulder subluxation can occur in swimmers with underlying shoulder laxity. For example, the overhead position of the arm during hand entry in backstroke can predispose to shoulder subluxation [16, 17]. Swimmers often have some degree of underlying shoulder laxity, and this can predispose to acute subluxation. Patellar subluxation can occur in individuals with underlying generalized laxity and, although uncommon, can occur during breast stroke swimming . Acute meniscus tears are uncommon in swimming, but symptoms from a degenerative meniscus tear in an older athlete may be exacerbated by breaststroke swimming due to the forceful rotatory and valgus loads on the knee .

Content: It should also be recognized that there may be an acute exacerbation of an underlying chronic condition. For example, a swimmer with shoulder tendinopathy ( ' swimmers shoulder ' ) may have an acute exacerbation of shoulder pain due to a change in training volume or frequency [16, 17, 19]. A survey of injuries in a NCAA Division I collegiate swimming program reported that freshman had the highest rate of injury, supporting the relationship between a change in training and injury . A careful history is critical to determine if an apparently acute presentation of pain or injury is actually an exacerbation of a pre-existing problem. Acute exacerbation of a pre-existing, chronic injury is rather common. NCAA Division I collegiate swimming program found that 38 % of all injuries occurred during dryland training . Attention to technique and careful performance of dryland exercises is critical to prevent injury from these exercises. Relative rest of the irritated region and a focus on core strength and rehabilitation of supporting musculature is the key to treatment. Overuse Injuries Overuse injury risk in swimmers has been reported as high as 4.0 injuries per 1000 athletic exposure (AE) [16, 19 -22]. In a study of swimmers at the University of Iowa from 2002 to 2007, the shoulder and upper arm were the most commonly injured areas followed by the back and neck . In the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program study for a 4-year span, the rate of overuse injuries in men was 0.66 per 1000 AE and in women was 1.04 per 1000 AE . In a study of the 2009 FINA world championships, 171 injuries were reported (incidence of 66.0 per 1000 registered athletes) . The most affected body part was the shoulder and the most common cause of injury was overuse .

Content: The unique environmental conditions of open-water swimming inherently belie the potential injuries. In addition, marathon swimming, with some competitions greater than 25 km, adds interesting physiologic conditions that can affect competitors . With training, most open-water swimmers do longer-distance workouts, also increasing potential for overuse injuries. As with pool swimming, the most likely cause of injury is overuse of the shoulder in training. The highest incompetition injury risk of any aquatic discipline at the FINA World Championship was reported to be openwater swimming . The risk of an in-competition injury was 57.7/1000 starts of female athletes with most of those being contact injuries with another athlete resulting in contusion. Environmental conditions such as water/air temperature, water quality, and aquatic fauna and flora create the most unique aspect of open-water swimming . Poor water quality can result in gastrointestinal illness. This can cause dehydration especially given the inability of athletes to frequently hydrate during races. Animal exposure (e.g., jellyfish, rays, fish, sharks, dolphin, seals, snakes) can all be problematic . Because swimmers will be in the water for such long periods, prevention of chaffing and rubbing of the skin is important . Exhaustion and fatigue can possibly exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions. This can be notable in both recreational as well as elite swimmers. Lastly, the team and swimmer are reliant on training and race support. On most open-water courses, the swimmer is some distance from coaches and land-based medical personnel, relying on lifeguards and other, usually boat-based, observers. However, boats, including those of support crew and media covering events can unintentionally injure swimmers if in proximity. Communication between the athlete, coach, and support crew is usually minimal.

Content: Swimming is a great sport enjoyed by all age groups at all levels of ability. It is a unique sport,in that it combines upper and lower extremity strength exercises with cardiovascular training in a non-weight bearing environment. Swimmers are unfortunately prone to injuries. Most swimming injuries are classed as overuse injuries and relate to faulty biomechanics. The most common swimming injury regions are the shoulder,neck, lower back and knee. Wanivenhaus et al (2012) highlighted in a study into epidemiology of swimming injuries that "An understanding of swimming biomechanics and typical injuries in swimming aids in the early recognition of injury, the initiation of treatment, and the design of optimal prevention and rehabilitation strategies." <!-- image --> Swimming overuse injuries usually arise from one or a combination of the below: - Poor stroke mechanics - Poor breathing technique - Poor flexibility or range of motion of neck or lower back - Hyper flexibility of joints with insufficient muscular stabilisation - Decreased rotator cuff or scapular muscle strength - Insufficient core strength/stability - Decreased hip muscle strength - Overtraining - Insufficient rest periods <!-- image --> Stretching is important for swimming because of the great range of muscles used when you're in the water. Unprepared muscles don't perform as well as muscles which have been warmed up ahead of exercising. A good stretching regime including at a minimum: - posterior shoulder stretch - pectoral stretch - long head biceps stretch - upper thoracic spine mobility stretch - latissimus dorsi Note - The above list gives a guide to what to look for in each of the specific conditions listed below.

Consequently, swimming was not exempt from injury risks, particularly overuse injuries affecting the shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle, and back . Among these, shoulder injuries were the most prevalent. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revealed that 34.7% of injuries in collegiate male swimmers and 36.8% in female swimmers involved the shoulder . Reported rates of shoulder injuries among competitive swimmers ranged from 40% to 91%, primarily due to repetitive overhead motions and the biomechanical demands of swimming . Furthermore, overuse and non-contact injuries were more frequent in women, with 63.7% of injuries reported compared to 44.4% in men . This difference was attributed to biomechanical factors, as female swimmers performed more arm revolutions per lap, thereby increasing their exposure to repetitive stress . At the elite level, swimmers trained up to 14.5 km per day, completing more than 2500 shoulder revolutions daily, which significantly elevated their risk of musculoskeletal injuries .

Content: The shoulder was the most commonly injured anatomic location, consistent with previous studies on collegiate swimmers and divers. 3,4,5,6 The proportion of shoulder injuries increased to an even greater degree in the swimmer-only subset (Table 2), as did the proportion of overuse injuries. Competitive swimmers perform 10 times the number of movements of other overhand athletes, 16 and may swim up to 9 miles per day at the elite level. 17 The biomechanics of frequent overhead motion involved in most swimming strokes also predispose swimmers to overuse-type shoulder injuries, often referred to as 'swimmer's shoulder'. 17 Injuries associated with freestyle and butterfly, two strokes that put the most overhead stress on the shoulder, 17,18 were also the most frequent in this population. Of note, it has been reported that swimmers aged 13-18 years believe mild to moderate shoulder pain should be tolerated to complete practice and many use pain medication to complete practice. 19 Such attitudes in adolescents are concerning and present important considerations for swim coaches and ATs in this age group. While our data do not directly examine the effects of sport specialization on injury prevalence, it is important that involved parties understand the potential risks of routine medication use during adolescence as well as the long-term consequences of 'playing through' their overuse injuries.

Strength training was the activity of injury for 30% of male swimming injuries and 28% of female swimming injuries. Thirty-eight percent of injuries for both the men and women were a result of team activities out of the pool.

Content: Another limitation of this study is that many elite swimmers and divers in this age group train outside of the high school setting, while competing but not practicing with their high school teams. 27,28,29 This creates a source of potential selection bias as these athlete injuries may be missed more frequently in our sample that relies on the reporting of ATs employed by the high school. In a recent survey, 79% of female college swimmers reported having also trained on a club team while in high school. 28 Club swimming and club diving, as opposed to high school swimming and diving, are usually year-round and often involve more weekly hours devoted to training, 27,28,29 leading to further potential to develop an injury. Interestingly, there were no statistically significant increases in rates of injury among swimmers and divers who also participated in club swimming and diving. On one hand, this is surprising given the significantly increased exposure to their sport, potentially increasing the risk of overuse injury. However, one might consider the counterargument that many overuse injuries occur during periods when training volume and intensity change significantly 7 , a circumstance which may occur less with year-round simmers. Regardless, this warrants further exploration in future studies, ideally with larger sample sizes which better characterize training volumes, as well as the change in training volumes over a sustained period of time.

Unlike other sports, it combines swimming, gymnastics, dance and ballet. Therefore, the requirements for strength, endurance, and /uni FB02 exibility, as well as the levels of execution technique, are greater to achieve performance (2). This implies great physical and mental exhaustion in collective and individual training, which can increase the risk of injuries. Injuries have a negative impact on swimmers, sometimes generating chronic pain or even the need for surgery, which causes a high number of absences from training and/or competitions (3). Additionally, in some cases, it can cause disability or withdrawal from the sport. Therefore, the development of effective preventive measures to reduce injuries is imperative to maintain the performance and health of the athlete in this discipline (2). As in all aspects of sports medicine, knowledge of the epidemiology of injuries within a sports discipline (incidence, location, type, severity) allows establishing individualised guidelines and strategies, according to speci /uni FB01 c needs (4). Several articles have described that the most common injuries in artistic swimming occur due to overuse of the knee, shoulder, and lumbar spine, due to the nature of repetitive movements in training (2, 5). Likewise, since 2015, there has been a consensus on the recording of injuries in aquatic sports (6) that can help understand and control the epidemiology of injuries in artistic swimming. However, research on the prevalence of injuries in aquatic sports, such as swimming, has been quite precarious to date from a methodological point of view (7), which could also be re /uni FB02 ected in other aquatic disciplines, such as artistic swimming, making it dif /uni FB01 cult to apply effective preventive programs.

In particular, the findings of this study underline the importance of tackling the beliefs and attitudes of adolescent competitive swimmers, who should be aware of the risk of further injury when they continue to train despite pain. 46 Educating developing athletes about stress and load management may also help to minimize the effects of external load and reduce the likelihood of injury. 44 Sports governing bodies should be alert to the increasing pressure that developing athletes face and beliefs about and attitudes toward injury that may accompany this pressure. The health of the athletes must be paramount when planning event calendars and overall competition loads. Finally, athletes may differ greatly in their response and adaptation to training. 44 As sport-specific and individual differences may also contribute to the development of shoulder pain in swimmers, our findings emphasize the importance of prescribing swim-training volume on an individual and flexible basis, with special attention to those who are at increased risk of injury.

Content: In swimmers most common injuries are ocur in shoulder and the second one is happend in knee joint. The prevalence of knee problems requiring an orthopedic consultation was 34% among the 35 members of the 1972 Canadian Olympic swimming team. Most of the knee pain problems are complained by the breaststroke swimmers (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012). The other styles are also complained but not as much as breaststroke swimmers. According to a survey 86% breaststrokers swimmers at least one time knee pain (Rupp 1995). Breaststroke swimmers have a fivefold higher risk of knee pain (relative risk, 5.1), although most occurs in the medial compartment, whereas freestyle has a reduced relative risk (0.5) for knee pain (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012). The biomechanics of the breaststroke generates high valgus loads due to the adducted hip position. Extreme hip abduction angles at kick initiation can be detrimental. For example, a study of 21 competitive swimmers reported that hip abduction angles of less than 37 or greater than 42 were associated with a higher knee injury rate (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012).

The knee is the second-most-reported source of pain in competitive swimmers. 36 The prevalence of knee problems requiring an orthopedic consultation was 34% among the 35 members of the 1972 Canadian Olympic swimming team. 19 A greater incidence of knee pain occurs in breaststroke swimmers than in other swimming techniques. 19,21,46 A survey of 36 competitive breaststroke swimmers found that 86% had at least 1 episode of breaststroke related knee pain. 38 Quantifying the true prevalence of swimming-associated knee injuries is challenging, as structural abnormalities do not always correlate with painful symptoms and vice versa. Swimmers may have a number of knee abnormalities that take many years to become symptomatic, if ever. A MRI study compared knees of asymptomatic adolescent elite swimmers to age- and sex-matched controls who did not practice any impact sports regularly. 43 Swimmers had a significantly higher incidence of imaging abnormalities (69.2%) compared with age- and sexmatched controls that do not regularly practice any impact sports. The most common MRI abnormalities were infrapatellar fat pad edema (53.8%), bone marrow edema (26.9%), prefemoral fat pad edema (19%), and joint effusion (15.3%). One limitation of the study is that these MRI findings also correlate with the dry land training included in the training regime.

Content: High school swimming and diving is a fast-growing high school sport in the United States, with participation increasing over 8% between 2008-2018. 1 While participation has risen, the scope of research with respect to swimming and diving injuries in the adolescent age group remains limited. Previous studies have described the epidemiology of swimming and diving injuries at the collegiate level, 3-7 demonstrating higher frequency of injury to the shoulder and/or upper arm, most often classified as overuse or non-contact, as well as differences with regard to gender and age. For example, female college swimmers have higher overuse injury rates than males; 3,5,6 college freshmen have the highest incidence of injury, attributed to an abrupt increase in training volume. 7 Literature evaluating diving injuries is more limited. College divers have been found to have a higher overall injury rate than college swimmers, the greatest proportion of those injuries being to the head or face. 3,5 While valuable in providing context for general injury patterns in swimmers and divers, these studies were limited by sample size and generalizability. For example, two of these studies examined only a single program, one of which is followed data from a single season. 4,7 More recently, Trinidad et al. performed a systematic review to describe the injury patterns in adult swimmers and reported a high prevalence of shoulder, knee, and low back injuries due to overuse. 8 However, methodological differences in injury definitions, data collection, and injury surveillance limited the ability to draw direct comparisons between the studies. To our knowledge, there is no existing literature that describes the epidemiology of swimming and diving injuries specifically at the high school level.

Content: It is critical that we evaluate data specific to the adolescent population, being that this group may be more susceptible to injury for many reasons. Rapid growth during adolescence may result in mechanical stress, such as muscle tightness across joints. 9 Training volume, a recognized risk factor for overuse injury, rapidly increases around this time for many swimmers; one study showed that training volumes among adolescent swimmers (ages 1517) were greater than younger age groups. 9 Finally, there is growing concern that youth sport specialization amongst adolescents increases risk of musculoskeletal injury. Sport specialization, defined as participation in one sport at the exclusion of other sports, is associated with higher training volumes both in terms of hours per week and months per year, potentially with burnout and overtraining. 10,11 Given the limited scope of available literature on swimming and diving injuries and the unique risk factors in the adolescent population, this study describes injury patterns across

Content: Artistic swimmers train their cardiorespiratory capacity by swimming mainly in freestyle, which adds to the repetition of the skills inherent to the discipline (arm actions in routines, rowing, and exercises on dry land) in training, and the large volume of hours of training (24), could explain shoulder overload. During these trainings, repetitive cyclic movement of the glenohumeral joint occurs (25). These repetitive and continuous movements generate great fatigue and friction between the different structures of the joint, which result in microtrauma to the rotator cuff, particularly the supraspinatus and sometimes the long head of the biceps (2), thus causing in /uni FB02 ammation and pain (26). Along the same lines, fatigue caused by pain generates a biomechanical alteration in shoulder movement that can trigger an injury (18, 27). Therefore, the repetitive practice of these actions for several hours daily could increase the risk of shoulder injury in artistic swimmers (5). Regarding knee injuries, a conditioning factor is the mixer kick that the swimmer uses to stay on the water ' s surface, while the arms move in the air (5). As it is a repetitive and widely used movement, it could be stated that the cause of the injury is mainly due to it excessive use (28). Furthermore, the frequency and technical intensity of the kick (29), together with a decompensation of the knee angle or a mechanical imbalance of the hip joint during it (29), could affect the movement pattern of this joint and cause medial joint pain (due to knee valgus) or anterior joint pain (due to abnormal tracking of the patella in the trochlear not chop the femur), which would increase the risk of injury (2). Therefore, the importance of teaching the technical execution of the beater kick and the breaststroke kick among swimmers is highlighted, in addition to carrying out adequate preventive work to avoid possible propulsive irregularities at a biomechanical level among athletes to prevent possible injuries.

Content: This review has several limitations. One major challenge is the variability in injury prevalence reporting due to differences in study designs, injury definitions, and data collection protocols, which complicate direct comparisons. Additionally, the limited number of epidemiological studies on swimming injuries restricts the ability to estimate incidence and risk factors, with most research focusing on elite swimmers, reducing the generalizability of the findings to other populations. To improve comparability, future studies should adopt standardized injury surveillance protocols, defining clear criteria for injury diagnosis, severity classification, and exposure metrics (e.g., injuries per 1000 training hours). The use of validated injury-specific questionnaires, real-time monitoring tools (e.g., SIMS-Med Sport Systems), and international guidelines such as the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) questionnaire would enhance data reliability. Additionally, integrating wearable sensors could facilitate long-term injury tracking and improve cross-study comparability. Future research should also expand to include recreational-, youth-, and master-level swimmers to improve generalizability. Longitudinal studies tracking swimmers over time would provide better insights into training load, injury progression, and rehabilitation effectiveness. Lastly, investigating how technological advancements in swimwear and training equipment impact injury prevention could offer practical applications for reducing overuse injuries. By addressing these gaps and standardizing reporting methods, future research can improve injury surveillance, prevention strategies, and long-term athlete health.

Content: Freestyle (commonly known as 'crawl') and butterfly strokes pose the highest injury risks among swimming styles, primarily due to the repetitive arm abduction and the elevation above the head required by these techniques . The repetitive nature of these strokes places significant stress on the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers, often leading to fatigue, reduced dynamic stability, and impingement syndromes . The shoulder joint, which plays a crucial role in swimming, is characterized by its extensive range of motion and is supported by ligaments such as the glenohumeral and coracohumeral . Despite this support, muscular coordination is essential to maintaining joint stability. Research highlights the importance of shoulder range of motion (ROM), along with a balance between strength and flexibility, as deficits in these areas increase the risk of conditions such as scapular dyskinesis and 'swimmer's shoulder' . In contrast, breaststroke swimmers are more prone to knee injuries due to the valgus and rotational forces generated during the whip kick, commonly referred to as 'breaststroker's knee' . Both butterfly and breaststroke styles are also associated with an increased risk of lumbar spine injuries, as the hyperextension required to maintain a streamlined position places considerable load on the posterior structures of the lower back . The cyclical nature of swimming, combined with high training loads, technical precision, and strength demands, further increase the risk of injury, particularly to the shoulder, knee, and lumbar spine .

Consequently, this lack of methodological guidelines made it dif /uni FB01 cult to compare all these results that would allow in the future to establish homogeneous and effective injury prevention guidelines. Therefore, it is relevant to change the trend of data collection on the epidemiology of injuries in artistic swimming and follow the established guidelines. Following this line, future recommendations should emphasize the need for a standardized injury surveillance protocol, especially considering the low number of studies that adhered to the FINA consensus. At an epidemiological level, injuries to the shoulder, knee, and trunk (more speci /uni FB01 cally the lumbar spine) are the most common among artistic swimmers and could be considered the main locations of injury. Also worth noting is the lack of exposure hours recorded in total; only two studies had exposure data during training (14, 20). Regarding the type of injury, like most sports, muscle-tendon and joint-ligament injuries prevail. Seeing all this data, it would be very interesting to create research around the creation of preventive programs based on locations and types of injuries. It is important to highlight that the use of different training techniques and different environments could mitigate the appearance of injuries (22, 23). This, taken to artistic swimming, could be interesting, since if strength or /uni FB02 exibility exercises are performed in different environments in the most affected areas, injuries could reduce its appearance.

Content: We propose an evidence-based platform that improves our understanding of the relationship between swimtraining volume and shoulder pain across the life span of the competitive swimmer. Although the limited available data on competitive swimmers make it difficult to provide sport-specific practice guidelines, our review highlights a number of general points that may serve as practical recommendations in the future. First, based on the available evidence, prescribing large quantities of swim training during the transition from young to adolescent ages may increase the risk of injury 37,38 and lead to early specialization in the sport. For athletes focusing solely on swimming, the risks of injury, overtraining, and dropout may increase. 49 Swimming coaches should be aware of and limit sudden alterations in swim-training volume that may come with an increase in the competitive level or a change in the training stage. The athlete's acute and chronic swim-training volume should be monitored year-round and compared with the data provided in this review. A well-balanced and gradually increasing training program may allow the athlete to be better prepared and protected for upcoming periods of intensified training. Second, our results also highlight the importance of participating in other sports. Although we cannot conclude that cross-training offers a protective effect against injury, coaches should be aware of and encouraging about the athlete's participation in other activities to prevent early specialization. 10 In addition, sport programs for the young should focus on the developing individual rather than simply on the performing athlete. 1

The greatest swim-training volumes S wimming is a popular recreational and competitive sport among all generations. Competitive swimming careers typically begin when children enter agegroup programs. However, as swimmers develop through adolescence, new challenges and the time-consuming demands of training often cause athletes to drop out. 1,2 In the United States, about 5 million swimmers were competing on high school teams, with another 336000 active on club teams. In comparison, only 22 000 National Collegiate Athletic Association swimmers were registered in competitive leagues during 2015-2016. 3 However, because of increased participation opportunities, swimmers often reenter the sport at an older age, with about 65 000 swimmers competing at US masters levels. 3-5 Injuries in competitive swimming primarily arise from repetitive strain and microtrauma. 6 This is not surprising when one considers the amount of swimming to which the athletes are exposed. In competitive swimming, coaches are widely known to prescribe large quantities of swim training at low intensity to enhance performance. 7-9 Because of these demanding and time-consuming training programs, Conclusions: Evidence suggests that swim-training volume was associated with shoulder pain in adolescent competitive swimmers (level II conclusion). Year-round monitoring of the athlete's swim training is encouraged to maintain a wellbalanced program. Developing athletes should be aware of and avoid a sudden and large increase in swimming volume. However, additional high-quality studies are needed to determine cutoff values in order to make data-based decisions regarding the influence of swim training.

Content: Likewise, trunk and spine injuries could lie in errors made during training, such as excessive repetitions, explosive speeds, arching with an excessive rotational component, inadequate neuromuscular training, poor stability, core strength and posture, as well as poor /uni FB02 exibility training (2). These errors have generated an increase in the prevalence of low back pain syndrome due to repetitive and rapid arching (5). Some movements performed during warm-ups have also required that the lumbar spine be maintained in hyperextension, as this achieves a streamlined body position; this can place excessive load in the lower back (27). Consequently, teaching, correcting and maintaining good swimming technique, modifying the frequency, strength, speed, and degree of hyperextension in the acute phase (5), as well as strengthening the lumbopelvic complex area (30), could help reduce the risk of injuries, especially in the trunk and lumbar spine of artistic swimmers (2, 31). Therefore, physiotherapists and physical exercise professionals should integrate this methodology into their training programs to improve the sports performance of swimmers and there by prevent possible injuries (32).

Content: Knee Up to 75 % of breaststrokers report medial knee pain . Medial knee pain can occur from strain on the medial collateral ligament, irritation of a medial plica, or, in unusual cases, medial meniscus tears. Patellar instability is another less common differential diagnosis to consider. Examination of the knee should be focused on evaluation of knee stability. Knee injuries from crosstraining such as weight-lifting, plyometrics, or running can be exacerbated by swimming. Improving hip flexibility and avoidance of an overly wide breaststroke kick will help decrease strain on these areas of the knee. Lumbar Spine Dolphin kicking plays an important role in modern swimming technique. With an increased emphasis on this facet of swimming comes risk of low back injury, as hyperextension with dolphin kicking can lead to pars interarticularis pathologies (e.g., spondylolysis). The L5-S1 disc is another common area of irritation with overuse. Similar to other areas of overuse in swimmers, dryland training, especially weightlifting, can exacerbate or cause back injuries [31, 32]. Also, similar to other areas of overuse, a prevention program with emphasis on core abdominal and low back strengthening can help prevent chronic low back complaints.

Content: Injury prevalence was reported inconsistently across the analyzed studies, employing diverse metrics such as injuries per 1000 h of exposure or the percentage of athletes injured over a 12-month period. This inconsistency aligns with findings from previous systematic reviews , where the lack of standardized reporting frameworks complicates direct comparisons across studies. This variability underscores the need for standardized injury surveillance methods to improve data comparability in swimming research. Injury rates were consistently reported to be higher during competitions than training, likely due to the increased intensity, physical demands, and cumulative overload associated with competitive events . These findings emphasize the need for load management strategies during competitive periods to mitigate the heightened injury risk. The primary tools for injury measurement across the reviewed studies were questionnaires, which, although widely used for their feasibility and standardization, may not capture the multifactorial nature of injuries or subclinical issues effectively . For example, while the LEAF-Q offers a targeted approach to assessing risks related to the FAT , it lacks sensitivity for identifying broader biomechanical or overuse injuries. Conversely, technological tools such as SIMS-Med Sport Systems provide a more dynamic approach, enabling real-time injury monitoring and the longitudinal tracking of athletes' health . Despite their potential, such tools remain underutilized in swimming research. Future studies should focus on integrating wearable sensors, digital tracking systems, and validated questionnaires for a more accurate injury assessment. These innovations can significantly enhance the accuracy, comparability, and depth of injury data, facilitating the development of tailored preventive strategies and contributing to evidence-based interventions.
