Abdulkadir Ekin 1

## Abstract

Swimming is a unlike sport that mix upper and lower extremity strength exercises with aerobic energy training  in  a  weightless  environment.  There  are  four  kind  of  strokes  are  officially know: freestyle,  butterfly,  backstroke,  and  breaststroke.  The  highly  repetitive  motion  that occurs  in  the  normal  swimming  stroke  can  predispose  elite  swimmers  to  musculoskeletal injuries  of  the  upper  limb,  knee,  and  spine.  In  swimming  upper  body  injurie  is  oftenly happened. Shoulder injuries are the most common injuries, with prevalence between 40% and 91%. Studies in the literature show that injuries can be experienced in swimming sports, and there are also methods of protection from these injuries. In this study, to explain where and how injuries occur in swimming and how they can be protected from these injuries.

Keywords: Swimming. Injuries. Muscle Imbalance. Anthropometric Features.

## Resumo

A natação é um esporte diferente que mistura exercícios de força das extremidades superiores e inferiores com treinamento de energia aeróbica em um ambiente sem peso. Existem quatro tipos de braçadas oficialmente conhecidas: estilo livre, borboleta, costas e peito. O movimento altamente repetitivo que ocorre na braçada normal pode predispor nadadores de elite a lesões musculoesqueléticas nos membros superiores, joelhos e coluna. Na natação, lesões na parte superior do corpo acontecem com frequência. As lesões no ombro são as lesões mais comuns, com prevalência entre 40% e 91%. Estudos na literatura mostram que lesões podem ocorrer

## Introductıon

Since elite athletes do heavy training to keep their performance at the top level, for example in wrestling (Halloran, 2008; Tatlici et al., 2021), boxing (Loosemore et al., 2015; Tatlici  et  al.,  2022),  football  (Koutures  et  al.,  2010)  injuries  are  inevitable.  In  swimming sports, where symmetrical or asymmetrical movement skates can be, too many physical and physiological needs (muscle strength, anaerobic power, neuromuscular skill and coordination, aesthetic and artistic movements and aerobic endurance) can cause serious injuries (Pyne &amp; Sharp, 2014). Athletes who display elite performance in this sport are people who started sports at the age of 7-8 and performed heavy training throughout their careers (Kammer et al., 1999). Apart from the injuries caused by physical and mental fatigue after continuous heavy training, many internal and external factors can actually affect as well. While some of the studies focused on poor swimming technique, flexibility or force imbalance other than fatigue, others  dealt  with  the  situation  in  psychological  dimensions.  One  of  the  reasons  why contradictory results are reported in the studies is that the specific movement patterns and physiological needs of the swimming branches are different and the injuries differ depending on these conditions (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012).

Swimming sports  cover  all  branches  that  move  in  the  water,  and  each  swimming branch can have its own water resistance density (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012). Water polo game is intermittent in nature, requiring avariety of different, intense bursts of activity, each lasting &lt;15 seconds (Smith 1998). Explosive loading is a type of loading that lasts less than 6 seconds  and  primarily  relies  on  the  high-energy  phosphagen  system  of  the  main  energy metabolism pathway, with some involvement of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Taşkuyu 2020). Apart from sports such as water polo, where complex movements can occur in  the  water,  sportive  swimming  includes  strokes  and  foot  movements  and  repetitive performances.  Sports  swimming  is  also  defined  as  the  athlete's  ability  to  travel  a  certain distance in the water in the shortest time possible (Özyilmaz, 2018). Sports swimming is a sport that requires both aerobic and anaerobic endurance, strength, power, balance, flexibility,

quickness  and  rhythm  coordination  (Günay,  2007;  Pyne  &amp;  Sharp,  2014).    .Swimming activities  are  performed  in  4  main  styles:  freestyle,  butterfly,  backstroke,  and  breaststroke (Karpovich  &amp;  Millman,  1944).  Since  these  branches  have  completely  different  motion kinematics, the contents of athlete injuries also differ.

Some swimming activities consist repetitive movements (Costill 1992). Injuries in the swimming branch are seen at a low rate, but injuries in the swimming branch can take a long time  and  are  exemplified  by  repetitive  micro-traumas  .  Many  injuries  result  from  faulty techniques or mechanisms, and an assessment of the swimming biomechanics of any injured athlete  should  be  performed  to  identify  errors  that  may  contribute  to  injury.  Injuries  in swimming should not only be taken into account by competitive swimmers, but also by the many recreational, master and fitness athletes who participate. Most injured swimmers are adults, bringing with them additional age-related factors that the junior competitor does not have that can contribute to injury. Injuries of swimmers should be considered not only while swimming, but also other factors in land training. Rest and other measures are taken to reduce the symptoms of injuries and increase injuries (McMaster 1996).

In free swimming style (crawl), different muscle contractions occur in each phase of the movement, and the repetition of these phases should be coordinated. These phases are; arm entry, reach forward, traction, traction mid phase, arm exit, and mid recovery (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 1). These phases need to be done continuously and with a specific technique (Pink et al., 2011) (Figure 2). Technically, deterioration will increase the risk of injury, and working with more than 20% of the serratus anterior continuous maximum force, which is one of  the  major  muscles  in  this  swimming  style,  can  also  cause  injuries  (Özyilmaz,  2018). Especially in long-lasting freestyle swimming performances, the decrease in the strength of this muscle due to fatigue causes the rhomboid muscles to work more (Pink et al., 2011). When the performance is long enough to cause fatigue in the rhomboid muscles, the shoulder area is particularly vulnerable and the risk of injury is greatly increased.

It is also known that supraspinatus and deltoid, which work as relators especially in the recovery phase, may cause some damage in that area after a while (Yanai &amp; Hay, 2000). During  the  recovery  phase,  scapular  retraction  and  elevation  should  be  performed  in combination with humeral abduction and external rotation movements (Özyilmaz, 2018). In this style, the arms form the propulsion mechanism, and lower extremity injuries are very rare. The area that dominates the movement is the shoulder and 80% of injuries occur in this area. Similarly in breaststroke style, although the legs are more active than the arms, the shoulder area dominates the movement. The arms start and progress simultaneously with full flexion and internal rotation movement, and body movement is centered around the hip (Özyilmaz, 2018). In the butterfly and supine styles, as in the free style, it is a bilateral activity, not in a reciprocal, unilateral pattern. In water diving, both shoulders are flexed, abduction and internal rotation, extension and recovery in the traction phase, while the arms are in abduction-internal rotation, and the arms are brought back to extension from the water (Özyilmaz, 2018).

As  can  be  seen,  in  all  swimming  sports,  varying  degrees  of  internal  and  external rotation,  scapular  retraction  and  protraction  shoulder  movements  cause  injury,  irritation, inflammation, rotator cuff tears-tendinitis, shoulder impingement syndromes, tears around the shoulder cartilage in that area (Ciullo and Stevens, 1989) (Figure 2).

## 2.1 Shoulder Injuries (Prevention and Treatment Methods)

Studies  have  shown  that  shoulder  injuries  are  inevitable  in  elite  performance, regardless of young or adult swimmers (Kammer et al., 1999). Impingement is the leading cause of these injuries. It occurs when the pinching tendons rub against the acromion located on the roof of the shoulder joint. Most elite swimmers experience the impingement syndrome also known as "swimmer shoulder". Although it is common in all sports branches such as basketball,  volleyball,  handball  and  water  polo,  it  is  mostly  seen  in  swimmers.  In  this syndrome,  inflammation  occurs  in  the  tendons  (tendinitis)  and  severe  pain  may  also  be centered on the neck or waist outside the shoulder. It is possible to be protected from this syndrome depending on many factors. The most important of these is to make stretching movements.  However,  there  are  factors  that  need  to  be  considered  while  performing  the movements, and the practices may differ from person to person. Stretching applications should be done in the same proportions to the back and front capsules. Greipp (1985) showed that shoulder pain will increase in cases of bad flexibility in the anterior shoulder region. However, keeping this flexibility at an optimum level is especially important for swimmers who are genetically prone to these injuries (Johnson et al., 1987).4

In  addition  it  is  very  important  to  strengthen  the  shoulder  area  with  rotator  cuff exercises (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012). However, the right exercise choices should be made. Especially in free swimming, stroke strengthens the inner rotator muscles in the shoulder; In free  swimmers,  the  inner  rotator  muscles  are  significantly  stronger  than  the  outer  rotator muscles. Considering the role of strength imbalance in athlete injuries, it can be said that resistance  training  to  strengthen  the  external  rotator  muscles  of  free  swimmers  can  be beneficial. However, it is a fact that during swimming, muscle contractions and contraction rates will differ according to swimming style and this will result in different physiological adaptations (Ünlü et al., 2019). Attractions of resistance training should be considered to be for the purpose of considering this matter. Apart from this, non-functional shoulder strength training may have some drawbacks. Exercises that increase shoulder range of motion and stabilize scapula are also beneficial. If machine strength training is to be done, there are some points to be considered technically. For example, the "pull-down" exercise is more functional compared to the "shoulder press" exercise in terms of strengthening the rotator cuff region muscles. However, in practice, the reel should be pulled towards the front of the chest, not towards the neck. In the "bench press" study, the deltoid region can also be strengthened in

addition to the pectoral region. However, the elbows should be kept at shoulder level and the bar should be held with the palm facing to the face.

Movement should be avoided when injuries occur and any pain is felt in the shoulder because degeneration from this syndrome can progress rapidly (Bansal, Sinha, &amp; Sandhu, 2007). The majority of patients can be treated without surgery. Anti-inflammatory drugs and cold application are among  the first things to be done in line with the doctor's recommendation.  After  the  pain  is  reduced  to  a  certain  extent,  rotator  cuff  rehabilitation exercises can be started with the doctor's recommendation. If the pain does not decrease, the history of the athlete can be addressed with an MRI examination and surgical applications can be  performed.  In  the  first  stage,  it  tries  to  reduce  the  pain  with  cortisone  injection. Interventions  such  as  subacromial  decompression,  resection  arthroplasty,  and  arthroscopic intervention are considered.

90 percent of swimming performance originates from the upper extremity, and almost all  of  these  injuries  occur  in  the  shoulder  area  (Pink  &amp;  Tibone,  2000).  In  line  with  this inference,  Weldon  III  &amp;  Richardson,  (2001)  reported  that  90  percent  of  the  problems  of swimmers who applied to a doctor with different complaints were shoulder-related. Especially professional  athletes  should  take  good  care  of  themselves  to  avoid  these  injuries.  During periods  of  heavy  training,  good  rest  and  nutrition  are  the  most  important  principles  of protection  from  these  injuries.  Sufficient  amounts  of  carbohydrates  to  replenish  glycogen stores, protein to recover muscle damage, and vitamin-supplemented nutrition to replace lost minerals. In some cases, taking sports supplements under the supervision of an expert may be beneficial. Supplements are known to increase performance as well as prevent injuries (Tatlici &amp; Cakmakci, 2019). Another important measure is to keep the flexibility of the shoulder area at an optimum level (Beach, Whitney, &amp; Dickoff-Hoffman, 1992) . Imbalance in the shoulder muscles can lead to deterioration of posture, and postural deterioration can cause injury risks (Kluemper, Uhl, &amp; Hazelrigg, 2006). In this direction, both flexibility and strength should be exercised together with functional training. In  free,  butterfly  and  supine  swimming performances, the swimmer manages the upper extremity strength by adduction and internal rotation  of  the  shoulder,  and  this  often  causes  agonist-antagonist  force  imbalance  (Birrer, 1986).  Pink  &amp;  Tibone,  (2000)  reported  in  their  study  that  adduction-abduction  force imbalances in the shoulder were 2.05: 1 in swimmers and 1.53: 1 in non-swimmers. This is the physiological adaptation that long-term swimming training shows in the body, and it is known that physical differences can be seen, especially in elite athletes, according to the sports branch (Popovic et al., 2013). Swimmers, this situation is more pronounced in the shoulder

area and occurs with force imbalance (Kluemper, Uhl, &amp; Hazelrigg, 2006). Considering that strength imbalance is one of the factors that affect injuries in sports such as flexibility (Isık, Unlu,  Gozubuyuk,  Aslanyurek,  &amp;  Bereceli,  2018),  it  is  thought  that  swimmers  may  need special training programs in the shoulder area.

## 2.2 Injuries of the Knee (Prevention and Treatment Methods)

In swimmers most common injuries are ocur in shoulder and the second one is happend in knee joint. The prevalence of knee problems requiring an orthopedic consultation was 34% among the 35 members of the 1972 Canadian Olympic swimming team. Most of the  knee pain problems are complained by the breaststroke swimmers (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012). The other styles are also complained but not as much as breaststroke swimmers. According to a survey 86% breaststrokers swimmers at least one time knee pain (Rupp 1995).

Breaststroke swimmers have a fivefold higher risk of knee pain (relative risk, 5.1), although most occurs in the medial compartment, whereas freestyle has a reduced relative risk (0.5)  for  knee  pain  (Wanivenhaus  et.  al.,  2012).  The  biomechanics  of  the  breaststroke generates high valgus loads due to the adducted hip position. Extreme hip abduction angles at kick initiation can be detrimental. For example, a study of 21 competitive swimmers reported that hip abduction angles of less than 37° or greater than 42° were associated with a higher knee injury rate (Wanivenhaus et. al., 2012).

## Conclusıon

Musculoskeletal  pain  caused  by  heavy  training  from  swimming  is  very  common. Proper  swimming  techniques  can  prevent  injuries  and  pain.  Coaches  should  identify  and change the  wrong hitting  techniques  that  cause  pain.  It  is  important  to  add  the  necessary strength  and  stretching  movements  to  training  to  prevent  pain.  Lower  extremity  muscle strengthening  and flexibility exercises should be routinely included for breaststroke swimmers. As soon as the athlete feels pain, the training intensity, distance and frequency should be adjusted.
