## A B S T R A C T

Background and Aim: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant concern, often referred to as a 'silent pandemic' due to its high prevalence and limited public awareness. This study explores TBIs in soccer, focusing on incidence, contact mechanisms, player positions, and the impact of injuries.

Methods  and  Materials/Patients: The  authors  went  through  PubMed,  Scopus,  and  Google Scholar  databases.  The  publications  from  the  last  two  decades  were  considered.  This  review evaluates various leagues, including the German Bundesliga, American Soccer League, and the English Premier League (EPL), to analyze TBI occurrences and associated symptoms.

Results: Concussions were the most common type of TBIs in soccer players. Head-to-head contact mechanism with an aerial challenge during play frequently causes a concussion. Defensive and midfield  players  were  suffering  from  TBIs  more  because  they  are  defined  to  perform  more 'distance headers'. Dizziness and headache were the frequent symptoms seen in soccer players. Medical staff is suggested to make a precise and timely diagnosis of probable injury, with educating the members by the latest guidelines.

Conclusion: Early  injury  diagnosis is crucial, and everyone involved, including officials, coaches, players, and medical personnel, must be aware of this issue. More research is necessary to develop preventive measures and management strategies prioritizing player safety.

## Highlights

- Studies show a link between heading the soccer ball and decreased cognitive performance.
- Defenders are most exposed to concussions due to collisions and aerial challenges.
- The study stresses the need for prompt diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).

## Plain Language Summary

The text discusses the potential short- and long-term brain trauma associated with soccer. The practice of heading the  ball,  which  started  in  Northern  England  and  became  standard  in  1863,  poses  risks  beyond  collisions  during play. Recent studies have shown links between heading the ball and decreased cognitive performance, highlighting the need for comprehensive examinations of TBIs in soccer. The article reviews the incidence, contact methods, impact damage, associated symptoms, and management protocols related to TBIs in soccer, aiming to contribute to the discourse on player safety and inform preventive measures. The study included publications from the last two decades and focused on male soccer players. The results indicated that defenders are most exposed to collisions, with head-to-head contact being a frequent source of concussions. Symptoms of TBIs can be subtle and often go unnoticed, but they can lead to significant cognitive impairments. Aerial challenges commonly cause concussions in soccer, and chronic symptoms like headaches and dizziness are prevalent among players. The study highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and education for players, coaches, and medical staff to recognize and manage TBIs effectively. It also discusses the challenges of diagnosing TBIs on the field and the pressure on medical personnel to quickly return players to the game. The text calls for further research to address gaps in understanding and to develop preventive measures and management strategies to improve player safety. The article underscores the need for increased awareness and better management of TBIs in soccer to protect players from long-term neurological and behavioral problems.

iven that soccer is a globally prevalent sport with  more  than  224  million  players  worldwide, concerns about the potential for shortor long-term brain trauma have gained prominence  [1,  2].  The  practice  of  playing or hitting a ball with one's head originated in northern England [1]. It grew in popularity following the Football Association's adoption of the original rules in 1863. The organization quickly set up a new rule prohibiting ball interaction with hands in 1872 [3]. Since then, the socalled head-to-head play has become a staple of soccer [1]. Heading the ball, deeply ingrained in soccer, poses risks beyond the known dangers of collisions during play [4,  5].  Detailed  investigations  are  underway  to  under stand the level, aspect, and potential repercussions of heading, including cognitive consequences, both shortand long-term [1, 6]. A recent study revealing a link between heading the soccer ball and decreased cognitive performance within 24 hours emphasizes the need for a comprehensive examination of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in modern football [7]. As a result, the number of G

head impact accidents involving a biomechanical force

Purposeful soccer headings are more common than incidental head impacts, but their severity is usually lower [8].  It  is  unknown  whether  purposeful  soccer  headings are harmful to the brain [9]. One controlled heading session has been linked to higher rates of reported concus sion symptoms, changes in postural control, and higher levels  of  corticomotor  inhibition  along  with  memory impairment  [7,  10].  There  has  been  evidence  of  brain white  matter  microstructure  abnormalities  and  cognition  problems  in  players  who  self-reported  long-term exposure to 885 to 1800 headers annually [11]. However, some studies have not discovered any appreciable neuropsychological or neurocognitive impairments linked to brief exposure to soccer headings. This narrative review article aims to evaluate the incidence, contact methods, impact damage, associated symptoms, and management protocols related to TBIs in soccer. By addressing the gaps in understanding the frequency and classification of TBIs in modern football, this study contributes to the broader discourse on player safety and informs potential preventive measures and management strategies.

## 2. Materials and Methods

The  authors  went  through  PubMed,  Scopus,  and Google Scholar databases. Search terms used were as follows: 'Traumatic brain injuries or TBIs', 'concussion', 'male  soccer  players  or  male  soccer  athletes',  'incidence',  'injury',  'cognitive  impairments  or  changes', and 'management'. The publications from the last two decades  were  considered.  Retrospective,  prospective, and clinical studies in the English language were included  in  this  review.  The  population,  exposure,  comparison, outcome (PECO) framework (with intervention replaced with exposure) was used to simplify the research question which is presented in Table 1.

## 3. Results

Most  players  knew  an  impact  was  coming [12].  It  is critical to be aware of impending contact since it helps you to prepare for it [12]. Defenders were most exposed to  collisions  and  aerial  challenges  common  causes  of concussions in the midfield (Figure 1) [13]. A frequent source of concussions in Major League Soccer (MLS) was head-to-head contact [13]. In a preliminary examination of sports-related concussion (SRC) video analysis in MLS players, visual evidence of concussion, observable signs, or both (loss of consciousness, gripping or holding the head,  dropping  to  the  floor,  being  sluggish  to  get  up, or appearing disoriented or confused) were discovered in  28% of match concussions [13]. Twenty-six unintentional head hits were documented in 20 players, or 37% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 24.3%, 51.3%) of players throughout a soccer season in France, with four players being  exposed  to  repeated  blows  two  or  three  times [14].  Involuntary  head  hits  were  experienced  by  60% (95% CI;  26.2%,  87.8%)  of  strikers  and  62.5%  (95%  CI, 24.49%, 91.48%) of center-backs [14]. Despite this, no statistically significant difference (P=0.22) was observed in averages of hits per player based on player position. In voluntary impacts were projected to occur in 44.1/1000 player-hours (95% CI; 27.1%, 60.9%) [14]. Forwards and center-backs performed more headers than other players due to their positioning in 'receiving areas' of the field  [14].  Despite  this,  forwards  showed  a  great  deal of  variation [14].  Defensive players reported being the most often to head the ball in a survey of the Norwegian professional soccer players, followed by forwards [15]. Otherwise, in a study conducted by Koerte et al. [16], center-midfielders  were  defined  as  'distance  headers' who were much more habituated to heading with higher kinetics, although only headers that occurred during training  were  considered,  and  male  sportsmen  were pretty young (mean age of 15.7±0.7 years). Videotapes and injury data from the Norwegian soccer league were collected  prospectively  throughout  the  2000  season [17]. Head injuries amounted to 2.0/1000 player hours, and  concussions  accounted  for  0.5/1000  player  hours [17]. Another research of players in the Norwegian elite league  acquired  and  evaluated  videotapes  of  all  head hits throughout the 2004 and 2005 seasons [15]. There were  19.6  head  accidents  per  1000  playing  hours  (in cluding referee stoppage time) [15].

## Type of TBI seen in soccers

Understanding the type of TBIs experienced by play ers paves the way in the future for football federations to  investigate  and  comprehend  how  and  why  these incidences of head injuries are observed so often. This current article reviews the occurrence of TBIs because many cases go unnoticed due to the minimal occurrence of symptoms related to TBI (Table 2). A study conducted in  Germany investigated head injuries experienced by soccer players in 13 seasons in German league Bundesliga [12]. It was observed that out of 1000 match hours, the incidence rate (IR) of head injuries was 2.22 (95% CI; 2.00%, 2.26%) [12]. Laceration or abrasion injuries were observed, which were the most common type of injuries [12].  In  Sweden,  a  descriptive  retrospective  study was performed to assess SRC prevalence in elite Swedish soccer players [18]. 35.3% of male players answered in the survey that they suffered from concussions [18].

Major  soccer  league  which  is  the  American  soccer league had an IR/1000 hours of 15.44 for a concussion during the 2008 to 2012 season, whereas for the 2013 to 2017 seasons, IR/1000 hours rose to 25.00 [19]. Additionally, the English Premier League (EPL), the prime soccer league in England, had an IR/1000 hours for the 2008-2012  season  of  14.21  and  2013-2017  of  23.20 [19]. Between 2001 and 2010, Nilsson et al. examined 136 neck and head trauma in 26 European professional football teams (2.2% of all injuries). Concussion was the most common type of head injury (n=48; 35.3%) [20]. From 1998 to 2012, Junge and Dvoák compiled injury data from 51 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)-sponsored competitions and four Olympic Games. The team physicians recorded 3 944 injuries, with 577(15%) affecting the head or neck. Concussion was identified in 81 injuries (2% of all injuries) [21]. Contact mechanisms of injury seen in soccer players There  should  be  implications  for  players  to  be  care ful in performing certain tackles so that the game can be played safely. Two methods may cause TBIs in soccer [5, 22]. Unintentional head hits and hits to the head from various parts of the body of players (head-to-head, elbow-to-head), hitting the head on the floor, football goal  frame,  or  even  strikes  garnered  by  the  free-kick, when the ball flies and hits the unready player with incredible speed, are the most common causes of head injuries in football [5, 14, 22-24]. Another cause of brain injuries in soccer is forces that are not high enough to cause concussion symptoms. Microtrauma and subconcussive brain trauma are terminologies that are used in these  situations  [5,  20,  21].  Deliberate  rebounding  of the ball to manipulate, re-directing, or even speed its path toward a target causes a lot of injuries [5, 22]. Sub concussive brain injuries have a cumulative, chronic, but less  severe  effect.  The  quantity  of  head  strikes  is  also crucial.  Professional  players  were  observed  to  smash the ball using their heads anywhere from 6 to 16 times every match. The more proficient the players are, the more high-intensity training  and  match  frequency  are required of them. This reflects a significant cumulative weight of head impacts during a footballer's professional  career,  which can last up to 20 years [14, 22-24]. A retrospective study conducted in the France neurorehabilitation unit in which recorded data was obtained from the French Football Federation mentioned that 47% of players  suffer  from  concussion  through  the  head-tohead mechanism, with an aerial challenge (61%) being the most common playing action responsible of causing it [23]. According to the literature, aerial challenges caused well over 50% of concussions, and aerial challenges  caused  94%  of  head-to-head  concussions [12, 17, 25]. In research conducted in France, elbow-to-head injuries accounted for just 8% of concussions, confirming the results shown when a new rule in professional football  for  men  was  implemented  in  2006  (red  card given  on  deliberate  elbow-to-head  tackles  as  punishment)  and  indicating  a  reduction  in  concussion  rates Type of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) Seen in Soccer: Understanding the type of TBIs experienced by players paves the way in the future for football federations  to  investigate and  comprehend  how  and  why these incidences of head injuries are observed so often. This current article reviews the occurrence of TBIs because many cases go unnoticed  due  to  the  minimal  occurrence  of  symptoms  related  to  TBI  (see  Table  2).  A  study conducted in Germany investigated head injuries experienced by soccer players in 13 seasons in German league Bundesliga (12). It was observed that out of 1 000 match hours, the incidence rate (IR)  of  head  injuries  was  2.22  (95%  CI  2.00-2.26)  (12).

[23]. According to preliminary data from the 2014-2016 seasons,  many  concussions  were  caused  by  contact with a competitor (71%) but also by contact with a fellow player (16%) [13].

## Symptoms acquired by the players

TBIs can be difficult to interpret since injuries with (accompanying) concussion symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed as a head contusion rather than a concussion or TBI. Due to weak symptoms or concealed post-injury signals by the player, concussions are readily disregarded by laypeople and even medical personnel [12]. A total of 41.6% of players exhibited concomitant neurological symptoms with 9.8% reporting dizziness in a study conducted in Germany, including a headache in the first 24 hours following trauma. None of the football play ers with midfacial fractures and or concussions showed any  persisting  neurologic  symptoms  in  follow-up  assessments at the moment of coming back or 6 months following  trauma  [26].  Both  forgetfulness  and  unconsciousness  were  reported  by  40.0%  of  elite  Swedish players at the time of concussion, with both symptoms being  more  common  in  men  than  women  (P=0.001). The most common acute symptom was dizziness, and the most common chronic symptom was a headache in Sweden. A player's health may be jeopardized if they ex perience persistent symptoms. Almost 10% of the par ticipants in the Swedish study said that their symptoms lasted  more  than  three  months.  They  also  discovered a  link  between  both  the  number  of  past  concussions and the occurrence of symptoms that persisted. After the  players'  most  recent  concussion  episode,  players with a history of concussions were more likely to feel fatigued,  have  concentration/memory  difficulties,  and have headaches. Dizziness (82%) and nausea were the two most reported acute SRC symptoms (59.2%) [18]. A total of 295 players experienced at least one symptom (concentration/memory difficulties, headache, exhaustion,  nausea,  and/or  dizziness)  lasting  more  than 24  hours  (88.3%) [18].  The  most  prevalent  persistent complaint  among  these  was  headache  (reported  by 271 players, 81.6%) [18]. For 61.3% of the participants, symptom relief took one week or less [18]. In 8.5% of the players, symptoms lasted longer than three months, and in 3.1%, it lasted longer than a year [18]. The players' awareness was certainly lost after these three headto-head collisions, according to a video analysis of the game played in the French football league [14]. A total of 29 head injuries exist (2.9/1000 match hours IR, 95% CI; 2.0%, 4.1%). Another study conducted in France saw concussions accounted for 48% of all injuries (IR of 1.4, 95% CI; 0.8%, 2.3%), followed by head/facial fractures (24%,  IR  of  0.7,  95%  CI;  0.%,  1.5%),  abrasions/lacerations (7%, IR of 0.2, 95% CI, 0.1%, 0.8%) and head/facial contusions (21%, IR of 0.6, 95% CI, 0.3%, 1.3%). The total number of injuries caused by headers includes 29 head injuries, which were all verified during the video analysis. The 'suspected concussion' subgroup accounted for 17% of all head trauma and included 1 zygomatic bone fracture and 4 head contusions.

Except  for  goalkeepers,  footballers  in  the  EPL  performed poorly compared to minutes played, assisted, scoring chances, and overall shots following a concus-

sion [19]. Concussions took an average of 10.5 days to heal, while 27% of concussed athletes returned to the game within 5 days [13]. Concussed EPL players averaged 0.5 fewer assists per year, 5.2 fewer games started per year, 3.5 fewer shots on goal per year, and 8.2 fewer total  shots  per  year  than  non-concussed  players [19]. Following  a  concussion,  non-goalkeeper  soccer  players in MLS experienced no substantial declines in total games, goals, assisting, shot attempts, or total attempts in the second half of this season [19]. Further examination of professionals who retired during the abovementioned  study  found  that  the  odds  of  performing  1,  3, and 5 years in MLS after a concussion were 52.6% versus 57.2%, 19.2% versus 25.3%, and 5.1% versus 12.7%, respectively, when compared to the healthy population [19].  Compared  to  healthy  players  in MLS,  concussed players  had  the  same  survival  rate  (log-rank  P=0.787, hazard ratio=1.03) [19]. After a concussion, the odds of playing in the EPL for 1, 3, or 5 years were 83% versus 59%, 56% versus 26%, and 27% versus 14%, respectively, compared to the healthy group [19]. Concussed players had a higher survival rate than healthy players in the EPL (log-rank P=0.0001, hazard ratio=0.414) [19]. 4. Discussion There  have  been  conversations  at  several  levels,  including the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG), FIFA, National Governing Organizations, and National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), concerning rule changes that would allow medical staff to undertake an immediate examination when an injury is suspected [13]. Any suggested amendments to soccer's Rules of the Game should  include  the  possibility  of  opportunism  or  tremendous pressure on medical professionals to restore a player to the pitch [13]. The precise and timely diagnosis of the probable injury is a key component of any successful concussion care approach [13]. It is critical not to overlook 'red flags' during a sideline evaluation to distinguish a concussion from much more severe damage like traumatic cord injury or structural brain damage [27]. Vomiting, neck stiffness, motor or sensory deficiencies in the extremities, double vision, and seizures are all red flags that indicate a dangerous situation  [27]. Referees, coaches, administrators, athletes, sports medicine  physicians,  athletic  trainers,  physical  therapists, neuropsychologists, and strength and conditioning specialists are all responsible for recognizing the injury  [13]. As a result, damage identification requires the education of these populations [13]. Officials' primary role is to keep players safe, not to diagnose injuries [13]. Any modifications to on-field evaluations must take current best practices for injury detection and evaluation into account, and such modifications must be disclosed to those who teach and educate officials and coaches  [13]. Education is a joint effort (Figure 2), and as members of the soccer community, we play an active role in ensur ing that this demographic has access to up-to-date, scientifically based knowledge [13]. Awareness, advancement, and policy change are all aided by education  [13]. Whilst  sensors  for  non-helmeted  athletics  are  being developed (e.g. mouthguards, earpieces, retainers, and others),  none  have  been  verified,  and  their  usage  in soccer outside of a research context is not now recommended [13]. Given the growing number of injury risk sensors entering the commercial market, it is critical to analyze the assessment validity and reliability of these systems completely and objectively [13]. While sensors for non-helmeted athletics (for example, mouthguards, earpieces, retainers, and others) are being developed, none have been confirmed, and their use in soccer ex cept in a research context is not encouraged at this time [13]. The 2018 Football World Cup in Russia first used spotters to aid and convey potential injuries to on-field medical professionals [13]. The risks and long-term repercussions of recurrent concussions highlight the need Given the growing number of injury risk sensors entering the commercial market, it is critical to analyze the assessment validity and reliability of these systems completely and objectively (13). While sensors for non-helmeted athletics  (for  example,  mouthguards,  earpieces,  retainers,  and others) are being developed, none have been confirmed, and their use in soccer except in a research context is not encouraged at this time (13). The 2018 Football World Cup in Russia first used spotters to aid and convey potential injuries to on-field medical professionals (13). The risks and long-term repercussions of recurrent concussions highlight the need to accurately diagnose and treat  concussions  to  prevent  athletes  from  experiencing  long-term  neurological  and  behavioral problems (27). While this is visible in traditional risk sports, such as American football and ice hockey, despite soccer's global appeal, broad recognition is only gradually happening for the sport (27). Head injuries in soccer are typically underdiagnosed, and potential effects are overlooked, due to the heterogeneous and generally mild symptoms of trauma [35]. Another issue that can result in players being not taken out of play when they should is the truth that the medical team is under a  lot  of  strain  (18).  During the  2014  World  Cup,  UEFA  established  new  guidelines  for concussions, allowing the referee to call a 3-minute timeout for the injured player so that the doctor can evaluate them (18). The following season, this was brought to Sweden [20]. It was disclosed in  a  prospective  cohort  study  that  on-medical  personnel  were  mostly  responsible  for  treating midfacial fractures in the field (26). After suffering an injury, most players from both teams went to a trauma center right after (semi-professionals: 86.5%; amateurs: 75.8%) (26). When athletes were diagnosed with a concussion or a serious midfacial fracture, they were only admitted to the hospital for 24 hours (26). According to current recommendations, which include those from FIFA, athletes who are diagnosed with SRC should be taken out of the game and examined by a medical professional skilled in managing concussions; they should not return to play the same day (28). It is advised to take a first phase of physical and mental rest (29). A step-by-step symptom-limited development of increased physical, cognitive, work- or school-related activity is then part of the return to academic and athletic processes (28). Figure 2. Education on Concussion Recognition

- On-field evaluations should follow current best practices for injury detection and be disclosed to officials and coaches.
- The dissemination of educational material should be clear, consistent, and easily comprehensible.
- Examine the measurement reliability and validity of injury severity sensors objectively

to accurately diagnose and treat concussions to prevent athletes from experiencing long-term neurological and behavioral  problems  [27].  While  this  is  visible  in  traditional  risk  sports,  such  as  American  football  and  ice hockey, despite soccer's global appeal, broad recognition is only gradually happening for the sport  [27]. Head injuries  in  soccer  are  typically  underdiagnosed,  and potential effects are overlooked, due to the heterogeneous and generally mild symptoms of trauma [27]. Another issue that can result in players being not taken out of play when they should is the truth that the medical team is under a lot of strain  [18].

## 5. Conclusion

In summary, heading in soccer has been connected to both  short-  and  long-term  traumatic  brain  damage  in male players. Head-to-head contact was identified as a major cause of concussions in MLS, with defense players being the most vulnerable to collisions and aerial challenges that result in concussions. It is crucial to diagnose injuries as soon as possible and officials, coaches, play ers, and medical personnel need to be informed. More research is needed to address the gaps in understanding regarding potential preventive measures and management strategies to enhance player safety.
