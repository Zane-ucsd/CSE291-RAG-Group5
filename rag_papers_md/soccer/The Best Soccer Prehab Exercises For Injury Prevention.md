Soccer is  the  world's  most  popular sport and demonstrates continued growth  in  the  United  States  each year. Over 13 million Americans play soccer,  and  according  to  US  Youth Soccer, there are over 3 million youth  soccer  players  registered  in the  United  States  today.  Although there are benefits to playing soccer such as improved  cardiovascular health,  strength,  and  self-esteem, there  are  also  some  inherent  risks involved. One study found that there  were  over  2.4  million  soccerrelated injuries leading to an Emergency  Room  visits  between the  years  2000  and  2012.  Another study  showed  that  soccer  is  the high school sport with the highest

3).  In  this  article,  we  will  highlight the most common injuries seen in

soccer and

teach you

research- based  soccer  prehab  exercises  to help prevent these injuries!

## Why Soccer Prehab Exercises?

Unfortunately, injuries are a part of sports. When it comes to elite soccer players, the average time missed from playing is about 2 weeks while the burden of the injury can last up to 6 weeks (4)! As we like to say, the best rehab is [P]Rehab and if we can reduce the risk of common soccer injuries, then we are helping people by decreasing their risk of missing time from playing the sport they love. The most common exercisebased strategies at the elite level include eccentric exercise,

neuromuscular training programs, strength and flexibility exercises,

core exercises, and balance/proprioception exercises.

We will outline all of these and much more but first, we need to educate you on the most common soccer injuries.

## What Are The Most Common Soccer Muscle Injuries?

Muscle and tendon injuries are much more common in soccer compared to bone contusions and fractures or joint and ligament injuries (4). Because of this, there has been plenty of research conducted as well as a lot of emphasis put on what are the best soccer prehab exercises for 'injury prevention when it comes to muscle injuries. There is evidence to support specific exercises being

## Hamstring Strains

Hamstring  strains  are  the  most common soccer muscle injury accounting for up to 50% of muscle injuries.

They tend

to be  more

common  in  males  than  females and

the most

common game

situations  in  which  a  hamstring  is injured  is  in high  speed  running activities during terminal swing phase and during a kicking motion when  there is simultaneous hip flexion and knee extension. About a third of athletes who suffer a hamstring  strain  will  experience  a re-injury  within  a  year  of  returning to  their  sport.    The  greatest  risk  of re-injury  is  in  the first  two  weeks following  return  to  play ,  and the second injury is usually more severe than the initial strain . Factors  contributing to  the  high rate  of  recurring  hamstring  strain injuries include…

1. Persistent weakness
2. Reduced extensibility of the musculotendonous unit
3. Compensatory movement patterns and biomechanics

4. Improperly addressing the modifiable risk factors that led

to the initial injury, and

5. Returning to play prematurely.

The key to effective prevention of any injury is understanding its modifiable risk factors . For a hamstring  strain,  a  case  can  be made for hamstring weakness, impaired  flexibility  of  hamstrings and quads, strength and coordination  deficits  of  pelvic  and trunk muscles, and impaired lumbopelvic  rhythm  all  playing  a role  in  hamstring  strain  injury  risk. However, the modifiable risk factor most supported by research is eccentric hamstring strength . When a player shoots the ball and is  going  into  hip  flexion  and  knee extension, the hamstrings must have enough eccentric strength to be able to control the rate of knee extension being produced concentrically  by  the  quads.  If  the quads have significantly more concentric

strength than

the hamstrings  do  eccentric  strength,

then the knee will be extending too quickly

for the

hamstrings to

control,  leading  to  over-stretching of  the  hamstrings and subsequent injury. Soccer prehab exercises for hamstrings should include eccentric hamstring muscle action  as  well  as  core  stability (58).

Nordic Hamstring Curl

## Sample [P]rehab Soccer Program Exercise

The gold standard for the hamstrings is the Nordic Hamstring  Exercise. Incorporating hamstring eccentric strengthening exercises  has  been  found  to  be successful in helping to reduce the incidence of hamstring strain injuries  up  to  51%  in  soccer  players (8). Eccentric exercises increase muscle fascicle length and improve eccentric

strength, thereby

addressing  two  of  the  modifiable risk

factors associated

with hamstring

strain injuries.

A

comprehensive hamstring strain injury  prevention  program  should include eccentric hamstring strengthening  exercises,  quad  and hamstring flexibility, neuromuscular control of the lower extremities and lumbopelvic region, core stability, and sportspecific movement patterns. If these  two  variations  are  too  hard for you, check out the read below to learn more about Nordic Hamstring Curl Variations.

## Adductor Strains

<!-- image -->

The adductor muscle group is made up of the adductor magnus, longus, and brevis. There are other muscles that contribute to hip

adduction including the pectineus and gracilis.

Due to the large adductor eccentric contraction

demands in sports training and competition such as soccer, there is a high prevalence of adductor muscle injuries . From research, we understand contributing risk factors to adductor muscle strains include a muscle strength ratio imbalance between the hip adductors and hip abductors as well as lower adductor strength was found during the preseason when comparing players who sustained groin strains compared with injured players. However, there is evidence to suggest including eccentric adductor strengthening exercises can potentially reduce injuries in athletes, specifically soccer players (9)!

Soccer Prehab Exercises For The Adductors

## Sample [P]rehab Soccer Program

## Exercise

## The gold standard for the

adductors is the Copenhagen Adductor as it demands high muscle activity of the adductor longus muscle and the abdominal muscles, both of which are protective against groin problems (9). However, this exercise is not easy for the first-timer! Below are some of our favorite alternatives

and starters for those wanting to

Adductor exercise! To learn more

Quad Strains

<!-- image -->

The quadriceps muscle group is made up of the vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vatus medialis, and rectus femoris. Quad strains are another common soccer muscle injury due to its biarticular nature (the rectus femoris muscle crossing the hip and knee joint), which

exposes it to a high risk of injury during fast movements such as

repeated sprints, changes in direction, and kicking motions. Injury risk f actors contributing quad strains include…

to

1. poor flexibility of the muscle
2. poor eccentric strength
3. previous quadriceps or hamstring injury

Again, the benefit of eccentric exercises is that they help with improving muscle architecture features, which include pennation angle, muscle thickness, and fascicle length. Improving these features can have a positive impact on muscle function as well as muscle injury risk . It is also worth noting eccentric exercises can increase muscle force and power values to a greater extent than concentric or isometric exercise! Improving eccentric quad strength is essential to reduce the

risk of quad strains from occurring

(10, 11)

Lateral Ankle Sprains

<!-- image -->

Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most commonly diagnosed injuries in soccer, accounting for anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of all injuries. Lateral  ankle  sprains  occur  when the ankle is plantarflexed and inverted  and  can  happen  when  a player is cutting, changing speed or direction,  or  landing  from  a  jump. Soccer  players  typically  have  tight calves, which may predispose them to  lateral  ankle  sprains  due  to  the relative  position  of  plantar  flexion caused  by  calf tightness.  Soccer players may also be susceptible to this

type of

injury due  to  the

specific  demands  and  movement patterns associated with the sport

.

## GALAXY HEAD ATC

An  ankle  sprain  with  no  loss  of function and no ligamentous laxity is  classified  as  a  grade 1 injury, and the  athlete  will  typically  return  to sport in 5-9 days. In a grade 2 injury, there is some loss of function with anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) involvement. With a grade 3 injury, there  is  almost  complete  loss  of function of the ATFL and calcaneofibular

ligament

(CFL)

involvement.  In  a  grade  3  injury, athletes may require up to 55 days

of recovery.

It is

important to

address the athlete's specific impairments that led to his or her initial  injury that  may  be  putting them at an increased risk of reinjury.

Research  shows  that  there  can  be balance impairments and compensatory  movement  patterns in both the involved and uninvolved ankle for up to 6 months  post-injury.  In  fact,  up  to 34%  of  athletes  who  sprain  their ankle will experience continued pain,  swelling,  re-injury,  instability, or limitations in physical activity (1215).

Studies  have  shown a  decrease  in the  recurrence  of  ankle  sprains when a proprioceptive training program  has  been  implemented .

Exercises such as the Star Excursion Balance Test can be initiated immediately following an injury on the  uninvolved  side  since  studies have shown that usually, both ankles have balance and movement impairments in athletes who  suffer  a  lateral  ankle  sprain. Once  the  athlete is full  weightbearing, they can begin the balance training on the injured side.  It  is  also  advised  to address the  underlying  strength,  mobility, and  movement  impairments  that

may have predisposed the athlete to

an ankle

sprain in

the first

place

.

Lengthening and

strengthening the calves, as well as training  single-leg  stability  should all be utilized as a part of a comprehensive prevention program. Some recommended soccer  prehab  exercises  are  inch worms, calf eccentrics, star excursion,  and  single-leg  stability activities.

## ACL Injuries

ACL  Injuries  are  one  of  the  most well-known  and  feared  injuries a soccer player can sustain. Over 200,000  ACL  injuries  occur  each year  and  are  more  common  in female soccer players. Some studies  suggest  that  up  to  80%  of ACL injuries are non-contact in nature.

The mechanism

deceleration most

common of

injury task

is

a

with the

foot planted

flat into

the ground,

bodyweight shifted over the injured side, and a high knee internal extension torque coupled with dynamic valgus forces. Some typical playing situations that lead to  noncontact  ACL  injuries are  a change of direction or cutting combined with deceleration, landing from a jump in or near full extension, and pivoting on a planted foot with the knee near full extension.  The  forces  on  the  ACL are  the  highest  when  the  knee  is flexed to about 20-30 degrees. Studies  have  shown  that  female soccer players demonstrate decreased knee flexion during landing,  cutting,  and  deceleration tasks,  typically  staying  between  030  degrees  of  knee  flexion  (16-24). You can learn more about the ACL

here and

graft options

for surgery if you injured your ACL.

## Soccer Prehab Specific Plyometrics

Studies have shown that approximately  1  in  3  athletes  who return to their sport after sustaining an ACL injury will either injure the same  ACL again or injure  the  contralateral  side .  It  is easy to see why preventing an ACL injury  in  the  first  place  is  a  high priority. The intrinsic modifiable risk factors associated with an ACL tear are BMI, neuromuscular and biomechanical deficits, hormonal status, and fatigue. There are several ACL injury prevention/prehab  programs

out there, but the successful ones have

some  common  elements:  running warm-up,

dynamic stretching,

plyometrics, lower extremity strengthening, core control,  and dynamic balance with an emphasis on correct mechanics. The best results have  been  demonstrated when  the prevention  program  is implemented during pre-season and  maintained  throughout  the season . Soccer-specific activities that utilize a soccer ball might help encourage implementation and promote compliance, especially among youth soccer teams (25-27).

Soccer Prehab Exercise Specific To Core Stability

Trunk position can largely influence knee position, which you know by now matters with ACL injuries. Don't forget to include core stability soccer prehab exercises, you can make them fun with soccer included!

## Closing Thoughts

No, unfortunately, we cannot prevent all soccer injuries from occurring. That is the nature of sports, there is an inherent risk of getting injured. However, that doesn't mean we throw away soccer prehab exercises! The goal of [P]Rehab is to mitigate the level of risk, we want to change the

narrative from injury prevention to

risk reduction as this is a more

accurate statement! That is why being a pro soccer player is a fulltime job year-round. Players have to take care of their bodies, they train in order to expose their bodies to the demands of their sport in an effort to be prepared to perform at the highest level with the lowest risk of injury!

But, some scientific research suggests otherwise. Recent evidence suggests there is no highlevel scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of exercise strategies to prevent muscle injuries in elite footballers (4). However, the systematic review (a type of literature review that critically appraises other research studies) heavily weighted the risk of bias . What the study deemed to increase the risk of bias included blinding, exposure to training and competitions, training and match

loads, type of training, and more.

What is important to note is the study only looked at elite soccer

players in the top 3 divisions, whereas there is plenty of evidence in other soccer demographics to support soccer injury prevention exercises. We also have to take into consideration what affected the risk of bias in regards to the studies they appraised.

At the elite level, no professional organization is going to blind their fitness coaches and physiotherapists to the research being conducted on their squad. Also, teams are less inclined to report the details of their proprietary training methods or their player's training loads as this could risk the competitive edge one club has on another. In our opinion and likely the opinion of many others, soccer prehab exercises still have tremendous

value!
