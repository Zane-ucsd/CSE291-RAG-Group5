## ABSTRACT

Muscle injuries are the most frequent traumas occurring in sports, and among those, the hamstrings are the most commonly affected. Hamstring injuries often cause pain and  dysfunction,  as  well  as  the  inability  to  return  to  practice  and  competition.  The severity of the injury determines the management and the amount of time an athlete must take off,  which  can  be  very  costly  to  his  career.  An  appropriate  diagnosis  and treatment is crucial for optimizing the recovery and minimizing the time spent inactive. Most injuries  have  an  indication  for  being  managed  conservatively  and  studies  have shown very positive outcomes. The use of growth factors to aid muscle rehabilitation has been growing in popularity -Platelet-rich plasma, platelet-rich fibrin and corticosteroids have been the subject of many recent studies on this matter. Up to this point,  platelet-rich  plasma  has  shown  the  most  promising  results  in  aiding  the  nonoperative treatment. The rehabilitation should be injury tailored and have a progressive increase in intensity, range  of motion  and  eccentric  resistance, and  end  with neuromuscular control and sports specific exercises. In this article, we set to review the current approach to diagnosing and managing a hamstring injury in athletes.

## INTRODUCTION

Hamstring injuries are among the most frequent lower limb trauma occurring in sports, affecting both professional and amateur athletes.[1-3] These have become a matter of rising  importance  because  the  time  off  an  athlete  must  take  from  his  career  is  very costly  for  himself  and  his  team  and  can  affect  his  future  performance.[4]  Hamstring injuries can be any strain or tear of any of the muscles or tendons within the hamstring group. Despite being a common injury, the optimal treatment is still controversial and is heavily dependent  on the severity of the injury. This review summarizes  the epidemiology,  risk  factors,  anatomy  and  physiology,  before tackling the current approach to diagnosing and treating the injury.

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

Hamstring injuries are a common factor in most prolonged pauses from training and competition in athlete's careers and usually more than one muscle is involved.

Anatomically,  hamstring  injuries  occur  most  frequently  in  the  myotendinous  junction, where  muscle  and  tendon  fibres  intersect.[5]  Injuries  are  most  likely  to  occur  when hamstrings are stretched - hip flexion combined with knee extension - during eccentric contraction,  therefore  they  are  more  prevalent  in  sports  such  as  soccer,  football, running  and  water-skiing,  where  sprinting,  running  and/or  rapid  changes  of  direction are  required.[3,  6,  7]  Hamstring  strains  and  partial  tear  are  the  most  frequently occurring form of injury, whereas complete ruptures are less common.[8] Less frequent are avulsion injuries, where the hamstring tendon tears from the bone. Proximal injuries are more common than distal injuries regardless of which muscles are involved.[9]

## ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY

Hamstrings  consist  of  3  muscles:  semimembranosus,  semitendinosus,  and  biceps femoris with its long and short head. To understand the anatomy and the physiology predisposing the injuries, it is necessary to know the hamstrings act as hip extenders and knee flexors. During locomotion, the hamstrings are involved in extension, flexion and stabilization of the knee and hip, since all these muscles, except the short head of the biceps femoris, cross both joints.[10] All 3 muscles have the same point of origin on the ischial tuberosity. The semitendinosus and semimembranosus both descend along the medial portion of the thigh to insert on the pes anserinus and posteromedial portion of  the  tibia,  accordingly.  The  long  and  short  heads  of  the  biceps  femoris  have  their insertion mostly on the fibular head.[5]

All the hamstring muscles are innervated by the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve except for the short head of the biceps, which is innervated by the peroneal branch.

## RISK FACTORS

Risk factors for hamstring can be categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable.[11-13]

Modifiable risk factors include inadequate warm-up, increased training volume, muscle fatigue,  hamstring  stiffness  and  inflexibility,  and  hamstring  weakness  relative  to  the quadriceps.  Non-modifiable  risk  factors  include  previous  hamstring  or  lower  limb muscle  injury,  older  age  and  African  or  Aboriginal  ethnic  origin.[14]  In  athletes, especially soccer and football players, speed and kicking positions also increase the risk  of  injury.  Previous  hamstring  injury  is  the  most  preponderant  risk  factor  and  is associated with the highest rate of reinjury, depending on the size and severity of the initial  injury.[15] This is thought to be caused by architectural changes in the muscle, where normal muscle tissue is replaced by scar tissue.[5]

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The  clinical  presentation  of  a  hamstring  injury  may  vary  depending  on  the  grade, location, and mechanism of injury.

An  acute  hamstring  injury  usually  presents  itself  with  an  abrupt,  sharp  pain  in  the posterior aspect of the thigh, which can be associated with the onset of ecchymosis.[16]  This  sudden  pain  can  be  concomitant  to  an  audible  pop  and  a substantial  loss  of  strength  in  the  affected  limb.  Following  this  injury,  patients  may avoid movements such as hip and knee flexion to reduce pain, and load bearing will be affected. This makes it very difficult to continue sporting activities and, in some cases, common  every  day  activities  such  as  walking,  sitting  and  standing  up  will  be affected.[5, 17-19]

In case of a complete tear of the myotendinous junction, there may be palpable muscle defects, such as lumps, associated to ecchymosis. These can be felt and seen upon contraction.[3]

Patients with an isolated biceps femoris rupture may feel localized pain in the lateral or posterolateral area of the thigh.[20]

Patients  who  suffer  mild  strains  are  less  likely  to  seek  medical  attention  since  the symptoms typically are alleviated within a few days following the injury.[19]

## GRADING SYSTEM

Hamstring  injuries  have  traditionally  been  classified  in  3  grades  based  on  severity: Grade I, Grade II and Grade III.[21]

Grade I injuries account for a strain of the muscle fibres. Grade II are partial tears of the muscle and/or tendon, they are presented with pain and noticeable loss of strength. Grade  III  is  a  complete  tear  of  the  musculotendinous  unit  with  complete  loss  of function, typically accompanied with pain and a large haematoma.

Additionally, for  description  purposes,  injuries  can  be  classified  based  on  their anatomical location - from proximal to distal - as well their degree of avulsion.[1, 9] These scales aren't however widely spread and therefore not very used.

## DIAGNOSIS

The diagnostic process should begin with a patient interview, asking about the context in which the injury occurred, pattern of the pain and how symptoms affect day-to-day activities  as  well  as  sports  practice.  Then,  it  should  be  followed  up  by  a  thorough physical examination and medical imaging if required.

## Physical examination

Like in every other musculoskeletal injury, inspection, palpation, range of motion and strength should be assessed. Firstly, gait abnormalities, such as limping and reduced hip movements, should be noticed. Patients should then lie in the prone position, where each  of  the  three  hamstring  muscles  should  be  palpated  from  origin  to  insertion, particularly the origin at the ischial tuberosity, to check for avulsion. However, due to their deep location, it is often difficult to determine the exact nature of the injury upon physical examination.[8, 20, 22] Hamstring injuries typically manifest themselves with swelling and ecchymosis localized to the posterior side of the thigh and, in cases of a more  extensive  injury,  haematoma.  Range  of  motion  and  strength  of  the  affected hamstring muscle should be examined by testing knee flexion with resistance applied at the heel, with the knee at 15° and 90° of flexion to evaluate eccentric and concentric contractions, accordingly. Testing shall be performed on both sides and comparing it to the  contralateral,  uninjured,  side  is  of  the  utmost  importance.  Weakness  and  pain noticed  during  examination  are  positive  findings  and  should  be  followed  by  further examination with the resource of medical imaging.[3, 22]

## Medical imaging

Diagnostic  imaging  in  hamstring  injuries  should  start  with  ultrasonography.  It  is accessible,  inexpensive,  innocuous  and  has  great  sensitivity  towards  these  injuries during the acute phase, when fluid can be found in the soft tissue.[5] It is however a very operator dependent test and doesn't provide very detailed image, becoming less accurate over time.

The  gold  standard  for  diagnosing  hamstring  injuries  is  magnetic  resonance  imaging (MRI).[3, 8] It is crucial when assessing the amount of soft tissue involved as well as the location and extent of the injury, differentiating partial from complete muscle tear, number of tendons involved and amount of retraction. MRI findings are, therefore, very helpful when making the decision of whether to go for a surgical treatment, in addition to  being  very  useful  for  estimating  recovery  time  by  measuring  and  correlating  the length  and  cross-section  area  of  the  injury,  as  studied  by  Cohen  et  al.,  in  a  trial conducted with professional football players that suffered acute hamstring injuries.[23] The  authors  created  a  predictive  MRI  scoring  table,  which  included  the  age  of  the patient, number of muscles injured, location of injury within the muscle, percentage of muscle involved, extent of retraction and T2 signal length, each parameter scoring up to 3 points (table 1).[23]

Patients  whose  scores  were  above  15  were  found  to  have  a  delayed  recovery, whereas those with scores below 10 missed none or one game. The longest recoveries were  associated  with  patients  with  multiple  muscle  injuries,  percentage  of  muscle involvement greater than 75%, T2 sagittal plane signal longer than 10 cm and over 2 cm of retraction.

Orthopaedic  injuries  tend  to  be  diagnosed  with  the  help  of  radiographs,  but  in  what regards hamstring injuries, these will only be of diagnostic use in case of an avulsion fracture of the ischial tuberosity.[3]

## TREATMENT

Hamstring injury is treated depending on the location and severity of the tear. Patients with an injury in the myotendinous junction should be treated differently than patients with avulsion type injuries.[24] Treatment can be either surgical or a more conservative non-surgical approach.

## Non-operative treatment

Most hamstring injuries respond well to conservative management. The main priority of the non-surgical treatment is to control the pain and decrease inflammation caused by the  acute  injury.  There  is,  however,  no  full  consensus  on  what  the  conservative treatment should consist in.[22, 25]

The most agreed on and valid treatment is RICE - rest, ice, compression, elevation. It restrains the initial inflammatory response and helps control edema and haemorrhage. Despite that, recent studies have exposed its limitation. One of the main concerns is that  a  long  resting  phase  longer  than  72  hours  can  lead  to  a  bigger  loss  of  muscle strength and flexibility and can delay the return to normal function. It is thought that an earlier and gradual return to activity is related to a rapid recovery.[26] Consequently, the  POLICE  protocol  -  protection,  optimal  load,  ice,  compression,  elevation  -  has shown better results.[27] Optimal load means gradually replacing rest with a balanced and  incremental  amount  of  physical  activity.  This  also  contributes  towards  better regeneration and orientation of the injured muscle fibres.[27, 28] Protection provided by crutches, braces or other supports is also highly recommended to avoid further injury to the affected site.

It is necessary to point out that the non-surgical approach to treating hamstring injuries is dependent on its severity - for example, more extensive injuries to the muscle and soft  tissue  may  experience  a  longer  period  of  recovery.[8,  24]  Considering  this  high discrepancy, there isn't a fixed time protocol that can be applied, but rather a recovery program tailored to the patient's symptoms and level of pain, to ensure an adequate rehabilitation,  focusing  on  strengthening  and  regain  of  function.  Returning  to  activity prematurely may submit patients to a high risk of reinjury.[22, 29]

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are generally recommended and should be prescribed to  reduce  inflammation  and  pain  perception  in  the  earlier  stages  of  the  injury.  It  is effective  at  managing  pain  in  most  injuries  and  has  shown  to  reduce  inflammatory reactions with no harm to tissue healing in that period. For long-term use, however, it is thought that NSAID usage can delay muscle regeneration.[22, 30]

Corticosteroid intramuscular injections in hamstring injuries hasn't been widely studied and there is lack of strong evidence supporting this treatment. Despite that, Levine et al.  performed  a  study  on  football  players  with  grade  II  hamstring  injuries,  over  the course  of  13  years.[31]  Players  were  capable  of  returning  to  a  preinjury  level  of competition  in  a  mean  of  7.6  days,  while  reporting  no  side  effects  or  negative outcomes. Although there were no controls on this study, it has shown a very promising outlook  for  the  role  of  corticosteroids.  Other  studies  have  exposed,  however,  both favourable  and  unfavourable  effects  on  the  recovery  of  the  injured  muscles  so  this method  remains  controversial,  since  there  are  potential  side  effects  of  injecting corticosteroids into injured muscles.[32, 33]

Platelet-rich  plasma  (PRP)  is  currently  being  investigated  for  its  effectiveness  in speeding  the  healing  of  hamstring  injuries.  To  produce  PRP,  a  double  spin  of  the patient's  whole  blood  is  required,[34]  but  despite  its  increase  in  popularity,  clinical evidence to define the preferred method regarding the injectable volume, timing of the application  and  number  of  injections  is  lacking.[33,  35]  The  argument  for  the  use  of PRP relies on the theory that growth factors and cytokines released by the platelets would  enhance  the  natural  recovery  process.  PRP  also  has  an  established  painrelieving effect provided.[36]

There are a few randomized controlled tests that have investigated the effect of PRP injections  in  hamstring  injuries.  End  results  vary,  but  the  lack  of  secondary  and deleterious effects was transversal to all trials.[33] Bubnov et al. performed a study with thirty  grade  2  hamstring  injuries,  split  into  two  groups.[37]  One  control  group  who received standard conservative treatment and another group receiving a PRP injection plus the same conservative treatment. Pain, muscle function and range of motion were significantly improved in the first three weeks of treatment, whereas in the fourth week results were similar. The average time to return to activity was 10 ± 2 days in the group that  received  the  PRP  treatment,  compared  to  22  ±  1.5  days  in  the  control  group. Hamid et al. conducted a trial with 28 patients with Grade 2 hamstring muscle injuries divided  into  two  groups.[36]  One  group  received  a  standard  rehabilitation,  while  the other group had the same rehabilitation in addition to a 3ml PRP injection administrated to  the  injured  area  with  ultrasound  guidance.  Those  who  received  the  PRP  injection achieved  had  a  significantly  faster  recovery  period  than  those  in  the  standard rehabilitation group with an average return to play time of 26.7 ± 7.0 days, as opposed to the 42.5 ± 20.6 of the control group. As reported before, during the length of the trial, significantly lower pain levels were registered in the group treated with PRP.

We  found  one  randomized  controlled  test,  where  PRP  was  no  better  than  placebo injection.  Reurink  et  al.  performed  a  double-blind  placebo-controlled  test  with  80 professional and recreational athletes with acute hamstring injuries.[38] One group was administered  a  3  ml  injection  of  PRP  and  the  other  group  an  isotonic  saline  as  a placebo, within 5 days of initial  injury.  A  second  dose  was  administered  5  to  7  days after  the  first  injection.  Both  groups  received  the  same  progress-based  rehabilitation treatment.  In  the  end,  both  placebo  and  PRP  groups  took  the  same  42  days  on average to return to pre-injury level of activity.

PRP  contains  a  combination  of  growth  factors  such  as  vascular  endothelial  growth factor  and  transforming  growth  factor  β,  which  are  thought  to  be  the  responsible  for muscle repair [33]. We expect that in the future it will be possible to pinpoint the factors with healing properties from those with less relevance and more trials are still required before it becomes a globally accepted treatment. Although PRP is no longer prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), there are regulations on its administration.[39]

Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) production is a more recent and simplified method, since it does not require the use of thrombin and anticoagulants, unlike PRP.[40] Here, after the first centrifugation, due to the lack of anticoagulants in these samples, a fibrin clot formation forms in the middle layer, which is then taken and centrifuged again. Upon administration, PRF provides a continuous release of growth factors throughout a 10day period, as opposed to the immediate release in PRP injections.[41] Being relatively new method of treatment, there is still little evidence to  allow full recommendation of PRF over PRP, but as of now it seems PRP can be recommended for fast delivery of growth factors whereas PRF is more adequate for long term release.

Physical therapy plays an important role in rehabilitation of hamstring injuries, despite the lack of a well-defined, evidence based, protocol. The approach and the exercises used may vary, but there are some general principles that should be followed (table 2).[22]

Initial  physical  therapy  should  be  managing  the  pain,  reducing  the  edema  and preventing  muscle  atrophy.  Once  the  initial  pain  and  swelling  has  subsided,  it  is acceptable to  initiate  physical  exercises.  It  should  focus  firstly  on  regaining  flexibility and only afterwards on strengthening the muscles.

Rehabilitation can be divided in three phases. In the first one, the goals are to protect scar  development  and  minimize  muscle  atrophy. Excessive  lengthening of the hamstrings, which would aggravate the initial lesion, should be avoided, and ice should be applied 2 to 3 times a day. Patients should develop the ability to walk and perform daily tasks without pain and perform prone knee flexion with minimal resistance. The second phase focuses on regaining pain-free, mid-range, hamstring strength, while still avoiding end-range lengthening of the muscles. Movement speed should be increased progressively  to  develop  neuromuscular  control  over  the  injured  limb.  Ice  should  be applied 10 to 15 minutes after exercise. Before passing onto the next phase, patients should be capable of jogging in moderate intensity, as well as performing full strength prone knee flexion without pain. In the third and last phase, the patient's goal is to be symptom-free during all activities. Normal concentric and eccentric hamstring strength through full range of motion and speeds should be achieved. Patients should avoid full intensity exercises if pain, tightness or stiffness are present. Post-exercise ice should be  applied  only  if  necessary.  To  match  the  criteria  for  returning  to  sports,  patients should be able to perform full strength activities, have full range of motion and replicate sport specific movements near full speed, without pain.[42, 43]

Other  options  such  as  ultrasound  stimulation,  cold  and  heat  compressors,  and massaging have been considered as treatments for hamstring injuries, but there are no studies with results to validate them as being better than placebo.[17, 19]

## Operative treatment

The surgical treatment has three major indications (table 3).

Two of those are in acute circumstances: when complete ruptures of the hamstrings occur too proximally; or when two or more muscles are avulsed from their origin at the ischial tuberosity, with a retraction of 2 cm or greater.[8, 18, 44] Studies have reported that  the  non-operative  treatment  of  these  injuries  is  associated  to  a  longer  period  of recovery with worse results, particularly noticeable during heavy activity. Patients who undergo surgical repair during the acute phase tend to be significantly more satisfied with the end results, having more efficient pain relief, better strength and endurance, and a quicker return to preinjury level of sport than patients who opt for nonoperative treatment.[45-47] Therefore, surgical treatment for acute complete proximal hamstring ruptures is highly recommended in elite athletes. A study has shown that athletically active patients who underwent surgery were able to return to sport in an average of 6 months.[45]  Finally,  when  avulsion  occurs  with  hamstring  retraction,  delaying  the surgical  treatment  can  lead  to  a  more  technically  challenging  surgery  and  could increase the occurrence of sciatic nerve symptoms.[9]

The chronic indication for surgery is hamstring syndrome. Patients who suffer from this syndrome have a history of chronic hamstring injuries, causing scarring of the tissues, which can compress the sciatic nerve upon muscle contraction.[15] Therefore, patients often report pain in the area bound to the ischial tuberosity, irradiating distally to the thigh - sciatic nerve symptoms. A study performed by Young and van Riet included 43 patients  who  underwent  a  surgical  release  for  this  diagnosis  with  very  positive outcomes.[48] Patients who undergo the surgical treatment should then follow a very similar rehabilitation plan to the one listed for the conservative treatment (table 2).[22,

44]

## CONCLUSIONS

There is still some controversy regarding the treatment and rehabilitation protocols for hamstring  injuries  in  athletes,  but  some  general  principles  can  aid  the  orthopaedic surgeon in the decision-making process. Most injuries are managed conservatively with good and excellent results. Currently, PRP shows the most promising results in aiding non-operative treatment. Complete  injury of all three hamstrings and proximal avulsions with 2 cm of retraction have the strongest surgical indication. The main goals of the rehabilitation protocol are to return the athlete to activity at a pre-injury level of performance and to minimize risk of reinjury, focusing on eccentric and proprioceptive exercises.  Each  individual  should  have  an  injury  tailored  rehabilitation  plan.  Further studies will help to define and optimize a protocol for the treatment and rehabilitation of these lesions.

## Narrative reviews

We consider narrative reviews of general topics of importance to the sports and exercise medicine clinician. Authors should clearly outline in their cover letter why a narrative review is appropriate rather than a systematic review.

All titles should include 'a Narrative Review'.

Please include a summary box summarising in 3-4 bullet points 'What is already known' and 'What are the new findings'.

Word count: up to 4000 words Abstract: up to 250 words Tables/illustrations: Maximum 6 tables and/or figures References: up to 80 MCQs required

## Formatting Guidelines

## Title page

This is  excluded for  the  journal BMJ Quality and Safety which operates tripleblind peer review.

The title page must contain the following information:

- Title of the article.
- Full name, postal address, e-mail and telephone number of the corresponding author.
- Full name, department, institution, city and country of all co-authors.
- Word count, excluding title page, abstract, references, figures and tables.

## Keywords

Authors can usually opt to (or are required to) choose keywords relevant to the content  of  the  manuscript  during  the  submission  process.  This  assists  in  the identification  of  the  most  suitable  reviewers  for  the  manuscript.  The  selected keywords should also be included in the abstract itself.

## Manuscript format

The manuscript must be submitted as a  Word document ( BMJ  Case Reports and Veterinary Record Case Reports request that authors submit using a template which should also be in Word format). PDF is not accepted. The manuscript should be presented in the following order:

- Title page.
- Abstract, or a summary for case reports (Note: references should not be included in abstracts or summaries).
- Main  text  separated  under  appropriate  headings  and  subheadings  using  the following hierarchy: BOLD CAPS, bold lower case, Plain text, Italics.
- Tables should be in Word format and placed in the main text where the table is first cited. Tables should also be cited in numerical order.
- Acknowledgments, Competing Interests, Funding and all other required statements.
- References. All references should be cited in the main text in numerical order.

Figures  must  be  uploaded  as  separate  files  (view  further  details  under  the Figures/illustrations  section).  All  figures  must  be  cited  within  the  main  text  in numerical order and legends should be provided at the end of the manuscript.

Online Supplementary materials should be uploaded using the File Designation 'Supplementary File' on the submission site and cited in the main text.

Please  remove  any  hidden  text  headers  or  footers  from  your  file  before submission.

## Style

Acronyms and abbreviations should be used sparingly and fully explained when first used. Abbreviations and symbols must be standard. SI units should be used throughout, except for blood pressure values which should be reported in mm Hg. Whenever possible, drugs should be given their approved generic name. Where a proprietary (brand) name is used, it should begin with a capital letter.

## Figures/illustrations

Images must be uploaded as separate files. All images must be cited within the main text in numerical order and legends must be provided (ideally at the end of the manuscript).

## Colour images and charges

For certain journals, authors of unsolicited manuscripts that wish to publish colour figures in print will be charged a fee to cover the cost of printing. Refer to the specific journal's instructions for authors for more information.

Alternatively,  authors  are  encouraged  to  supply  colour  illustrations  for  online publication and black and white versions for print publication. Colour publication online is offered at no charge, but the figure legend must not refer to the use of colours.

Detailed guidance on figure preparation

## File types

Figures should be submitted in TIFF or EPS format. JPEG files are acceptable in some cases. A minimum resolution of 300 dpi is required, except for line art which should  be  1200  dpi.  Histograms  should  be  presented  in  a  simple,  twodimensional format, with no background grid.

For  figures  consisting  of  multiple  images/parts,  please  ensure  these  are submitted as a single composite file for processing. We are unable to accept figures that are submitted as multiple files.

During submission, ensure that the figure files are labelled with the correct File Designation of 'Mono Image' for black and white figures and 'Colour Image' for colour figures.

Figures are checked using automated quality control and if they are below the minimum standard you will be alerted and asked to resupply them.

Please ensure that any specific patient/hospital details are removed or blacked out  (e.g.  X-rays,  MRI  scans,  etc).  Figures  that  use  a  black  bar  to  obscure  a patient's identity are NOT accepted.

## Tables

Tables should be in Word format and placed in the main text where the table is first cited. Tables must be cited in the main text in numerical order. Please note that tables embedded as Excel files within the manuscript are NOT accepted. Tables in Excel should be copied and pasted into the manuscript Word file.

Tables  should  be  self-explanatory  and  the  data  they  contain  must  not  be duplicated in the text or figures. Any tables submitted that are longer/larger than 2 pages will be published as online only supplementary material.

## Multimedia files

You may submit multimedia files to enhance your article. Video files are preferred in  .WMF or .AVI formats, but can also be supplied as .FLV, .Mov, and .MP4. When submitting,  please  ensure  you  upload  them  using  the  File  Designation 'Supplementary File - Video'.

## References

Authors are responsible for the accuracy of cited references and these should be checked before the manuscript is submitted.

## Citing in the text

References  must  be  numbered  sequentially  as  they  appear  in  the  text. References cited in figures or tables (or in their legends and footnotes) should appear at the end of the reference list to avoid re-numbering if tables and figures are moved around at peer review/proof stage. Reference numbers in the text should be  inserted  immediately  after  punctuation  (with  no  word  spacing)-for example,[6] not [6].

Where more than one reference is cited, these should be separated by a comma, for example,[1, 4, 39]. For sequences of consecutive numbers, give the first and last  number  of  the  sequence  separated  by  a  hyphen,  for  example,[22-25]. References provided in this format are translated during the production process to superscript type, and act as hyperlinks from the text to the quoted references in electronic forms of the article.

Please  note  that  if  references  are  not  cited  in  order  the  manuscript  may  be returned for amendment before it is passed on to the Editor for review.

## Preparing the reference list

References  must  be  numbered  consecutively  in  the  order  in  which  they  are mentioned in the text.

Only  papers  published  or  in  press  should  be  included  in  the  reference  list. Personal communications or unpublished data must be cited in parentheses in the text with the name(s) of the source(s) and the year. Authors should request permission from the source to cite unpublished data.

Journals from BMJ use a slightly modified version of Vancouver referencing style (see  example  below,  or download  here). Note  that The  BMJ uses  a  different style.

## BMJ reference style

List the names and initials of all authors if there are 3 or fewer; otherwise list the first 3 and add 'et al.' (The exception is the Journal of Medical Genetics, which lists all authors). Use one space only between words up to the year and then no spaces. The journal title should be in italic and abbreviated according to the style of Medline. If the journal is not listed in Medline then it should be written out in full.

## Electronic citations

Websites are referenced with their URL and access date, and as much other information as is available. Access date is important as websites can be updated and URLs change. The 'date accessed' can be later than the acceptance date of the paper, and it can be just the month accessed.

## Law references

The two main series of law reports, Weekly Law Reports (WLR) and All England Law Reports (All ER) have three volumes a year. For example:

Robertson v Post Office [1974] 1 WLR 1176

Ashcroft v Mersey Regional Health Authority [1983] 2 All ER 245 R v Clarence [1868] 22 QBD 23

Wimpey Construction UK Ltd v Poole (1984) Times, 3 May

There are good historical precedents for the use of square and round brackets. Since 1891, round ones have referred to the date of the report, square ones to the date of publication of the report. Apart from not italicising the name of the case, we use the lawyers' style; be careful with punctuation. Here are some more examples:

Caparo Industries plc v Dickman and others [1990] 1 All ER 568-608.

R v Clarence [1888] 22 QBD 23.

Finlayson v HMAdv 1978 SLT (Notes) 60

Block v Martin (1951) 4 DLR 121

Official Journal of the European Communities: at the top of the page it gives the No, vol, and page and, at the other side of the header, the date. The abbreviation for the title is given in parentheses under the title. Jiggle these elements around to get, eg:

Council Directive of 14 June 1989. Offical Journal of the European Communities No L 1989 June 28:181/44-6. (89/831/EEC.

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

A DOI is a unique string created to identify a piece of intellectual property in an online environment and is particularly useful for articles that are published online before appearing in print (and therefore have not yet been assigned the traditional volume, issue and page number references). The DOI is a permanent identifier of all versions of an article, whether raw manuscript or edited proof, online or in print. Thus the DOI should ideally be included in the citation even if you want to cite a print version of an article.

PLEASE NOTE: RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF REFERENCES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE AUTHOR.

## Online only supplementary material

Additional  figures  and  tables,  methodology,   raw  data,  etc  may  be  published online only as supplementary material. If your paper exceeds the word count you should consider if any parts of the article could be published online only. Please note that these files will not be copyedited or typeset and will be published as supplied, therefore PDF files are preferred.

All supplementary files should be uploaded using the File Designation 'Supplementary File'. Please ensure that any supplementary files are cited within the main text of the article.

Some  journals  also  encourage  authors  to  submit  translated  versions  of  their abstracts in their local language, which are published online only alongside the English version. These should be uploaded using the File Designation 'Abstract in local language'.
