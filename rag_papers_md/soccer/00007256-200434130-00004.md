## Abstract

Several investigators have studied the incidence and causes of soccer injuries in male professional players; however, epidemiological data on injuries in female soccer  players  are  limited.  From  the  data  presented,  it  can  be  estimated that, on average, every elite male soccer player incurs approximately one performance-limiting injury each year. Nine studies on the prevention of soccer injuries  were  found  in  the  literature.  There  is  some  evidence  that  multi-modal intervention programmes result in a general reduction in injuries. Ankle sprains can  be  prevented  by  external  ankle  supports  and  proprioceptive/coordination training, especially in athletes with previous ankle sprains. With regard to severe knee injuries, the results of prevention studies are partly inconclusive; however, training of neuromuscular and proprioceptive performance as well as improvement of jumping and landing technique seem to decrease the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in female athletes. Prevention programmes are likely to be more effective in groups with an increased risk of injury. More methodologically well-designed studies are required to evaluate the effects of specific preventive interventions.

Soccer, or football as it is officially called by the F´ ed´ eration  International  de  Football  Association (FIFA), is the most popular sport in the world with approximately 200 000 professional and 240 million amateur players. The incidence of soccer injury has been investigated in several studies and varies sub- stantially depending on the definition of injury, the characteristics  of  the  investigated  players  and  the research  design. [1,2]   The  methodological  problems associated  with  sports  injury  research  have  been described in detail by Finch, [3]  Junge and Dvorak [4] and Noyes et al. [5]

Several investigators have described risk factors for  soccer  injuries  and  discussed  possibilities  for prevention, [6-9]  but only a few have investigated the actual effectiveness of preventive interventions. [10-19]  However, methodologically sound studies of injury prevention programmes are rare in all types of sport. [20]

A  theoretical  framework  for  the  prevention  of sports  injury [21] proposes  a  four-step  series  (figure 1):

- step 1: establishing the extent of the sports injury problem;
- step  2:  establishing  the  aetiology  and  mechanisms of injuries;
- step 3: introducing preventive measures;
- step 4: assessing the effectiveness of the preventive interventions by repeating step 1.

The present review on incidence and prevention of soccer injuries is structured following this sequence.

## 1. Incidence of Soccer Injury

In reviewing the literature on the exposure-related incidence of soccer injuries, the majority of studies focus on adult male professional players during the  year  (see  table  I).  The  highest  incidences  of injury were reported for players in the professional league of the US [22] and the national division league of Iceland, [23]  whilst the lowest incidences were for Dutch [24] and Danish [25] low-level players. The incidence  of  match  injuries  is,  on  average,  4-6  times higher than the incidence of injuries that occur during training sessions. Some  investigators  have analysed the incidence of match injuries based only on reports [26-29]  from team physicians or physiotherapists  or  from  video  recordings. [27,30-32] From  the data presented, it can be estimated that, on average,

every elite male soccer player incurs approximately one performance-limiting injury each year. [1,33]

Only a few studies have analysed the incidence of injuries in female soccer players. [44,45,47,50]   Because of the limited database and methodological problems  such  as  differences  in  the  definition  of injury, study design and characteristics of players, it cannot be deduced whether the overall incidence of injury  differs  between  male  and  female  players. Two  studies  that  analysed  injuries  during  soccer tournaments reported a higher incidence in men than in women. [26,51]  However, some types of injury, such as  anterior  cruciate  ligament  (ACL)  injuries,  are more frequent in female than male athletes. [52,53]

For youth players, the incidence of injuries seems to increase with age; [24,37,47-49,54] the 17- to 18-yearold  age  group  appears  to  have  a  similar  or  even higher  incidence  of  injuries  than  adults. [24,37]   The same observation was reported in a survey of injuries during 12 international tournaments for players of different age- and skill-level. [26]

## 2. Characteristics and Causes of Soccer Injuries

Excellent information on the characteristics and causes of soccer injuries in male professional soccer players has been presented by Hawkins et al. [33]  who analysed a total of 6030 injuries in 91 English professional soccer clubs. There are little epidemiological data available regarding injuries to female players. [44,45,47] Summarising the literature, soccer injuries predominately affect the ankle, knee joints and the muscles of the thigh and calf. The most common types of injuries are sprains, strains and contusions.

The  majority  of  soccer  injuries  are  caused  by trauma;  between  9% [23] and  34% [25] of  all  injuries during the season are classified as overuse injuries. An important cause of soccer injuries is contact with another player and 12% [38] to 28% [55] of all injuries are attributed to foul play. During a major international tournament this proportion is even higher. [26,56]  The percentage of non-contact injuries varies from 26% [39] to 59%. [38]  Non-contact injuries occur mainly during running and turning. [33,38]

Approximately  20-25%  of  all  injuries  are  reinjuries  of  the  same  type  and  location. [23,25,38] The importance of previous injuries and inadequate rehabilitation as risk factors for future injury has been described by Dvorak et al., [6] Inklaar, [8]  Hawkins et al. [33] and Arnason et al. [34]

## 4. Studies on Prevention of Soccer Injuries

Because of the limited information on injuries in female  soccer  players,  it  cannot  be  stated  as  yet whether  or  not  the  characteristics  and  causes  of injuries  vary  substantially  from  those  previously reported for male players.

## 3. Possibilities for Preventing Soccer Injury

Several  authors  have  discussed  possibilities  for prevention of a soccer injury such as:

- warm-up with more emphasis on stretching;
- regular cool-down;
- adequate  rehabilitation  with  sufficient  recovery time;
- proprioceptive training;
- protective equipment;
- good playing field conditions;
- adherence to the existing rules. [15]

These topics are closely related to the 10-point action plan to avoid sports injury proposed by the SportSmart programme of the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation (table II). [57]

Preventive programmes generally focus either on the reduction of all injuries associated with a given sport or on a particular type of injury that is extremely severe or frequent. With respect to soccer, three studies have focused on the prevention of injuries in general [12,13,15]   and seven others have evaluated the prevention of specific types of injury, namely ankle sprains, [17-19] severe injuries of the knee [11,14,16,17]  and hamstring strains [10] (table III).

## 4.1 Prevention of Soccer Injuries in General

About 20 years ago, Ekstrand et al. [12]  evaluated an injury prevention programme in male senior division players. Six out of 12 teams were randomised into  an  intervention  group.  The  prevention  programme included: the correction of training; provision of shin guards and during winter training special  training  shoes;  prophylactic  ankle  taping  in players with clinical instability or history of previous  strain;  controlled  rehabilitation;  exclusion  of players  with  serious  knee  instability;  information about  the  importance  of  disciplined  play  and  the increased risk of injury at training camps; and correction and supervision of doctors and physiotherapists.  During  the  6-month  follow-up  period,  the players  in  the  intervention  group  sustained  75% fewer injuries than those in the control group.

In a more recent research project, [13] the effects of a pre-season conditioning programme on the occurrence of injuries were studied in 300 female highschool  players  aged  14-19  years.  Out  of  the  total group, 42 players were randomly selected to participate in the Frappier Acceleration Training Program for 7 weeks prior to the beginning of the season. The training programme combined sport-specific cardiovascular conditioning, plyometric work, sport-cord drills, strength training, and flexibility exercises to improve speed and agility. During the 1-year observation period, the untrained group had a significantly higher incidence of injury (34%) compared with the trained group (14%).

In  a  prospective  controlled  intervention  study, Junge et al. [15] investigated whether the incidence of soccer  injuries  in  male  youth  players  could  be  reduced by education and supervision of players and coaches.  Seven  teams  took  part  in  the  prevention programme, while seven teams of the same age and skill levels were instructed to train and play soccer as usual. The prevention programme included general  interventions,  such  as  appropriate  warm-up, taping  of  unstable  ankles,  adequate  rehabilitation and promotion of the spirit of fair play as well as exercises to improve the stability of ankle and knee joints, the flexibility and power of the trunk, hip and leg muscles, coordination, reaction time and endurance.  The  coaches  were  educated  and  supervised through courses, practical demonstrations and individual consultations given by a sports scientist. During the 1-year study period, the teams of the intervention group were looked after by a physiotherapist who  attended  one  training  session  per  week  and supervised the warm-up, cool-down, performance of previously described exercises and rehabilitation of injured players. The incidences of injury per 1000 hours of training and playing soccer were 6.7 in the intervention  group  and  8.5  in  the  control  group, which equates to 21% fewer injuries. The greatest effects of the intervention were seen for mild injuries,  overuse  injuries  and  injuries  incurred  during training. Low-level teams benefited more from the prevention  programme  than  those  of  a  high  skill level.

The  three  studies  on  the  prevention  of  soccer injury  vary  substantially  in  the  characteristics  of players,  the  duration  of  the  interventions  and  the content  of  preventive  programmes.  However,  all demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of injury in the intervention group compared with the control group. It remains unclear which aspect of the intervention  programme contributed  to  the  positive  results because of the dissimilarity of the studies.

## 4.2 Prevention of Knee Injuries

The prevention of knee injuries in soccer players was investigated in three studies. [11,14,17] Caraffa et al. [11] analysed the effects of proprioceptive training on the incidence of ACL injuries in 40 semi-professional  and  amateur  teams.  While  the  teams  of  the control  group  were  asked  to  train  as  usual,  the intervention group received a special proprioceptive training programme of increasing difficulties in addition  to  their  standard  training.  The  players  were instructed to train at least 20 minutes per day during the  pre-season  training  and  at  least  three  times  a week during the season. Over the three-season observation period, the incidence of ACL injuries was significantly  lower  in  the  intervention  group  (0.15 injuries per team/season) compared with the control group (1.15 injuries per team/season).

Hewett et al. [14] investigated the effects of a neuromuscular  programme  on  the  incidence  of  knee injuries in female soccer, volleyball and basketball players.  Coaches  and  trainers  from  12  area  high schools were sent an instructional video and training manual demonstrating the training programme that incorporated flexibility,  plyometrics  and  weight training to increase muscular strength and decrease landing forces. Fifteen teams (366 girls including 97 soccer players) participated in the 6-week pre-season neuromuscular programme and 15 teams (463 girls  including  193  soccer  players)  did  not.  The incidence of serious knee injuries monitored over an entire season was significantly lower in the trained group (0.43 per 1000 player exposures) than in the untrained group (0.12 per 1000 player exposures). For  soccer  players  only,  a  trend  towards  a  higher incidence  in  the  untrained  group  (0.56  per  1000

player exposures) than in trained group (0 per 1000 player exposures) was observed.

A large, but not yet published study on the prevention of ACL injuries in 14- to 18-year-old female soccer players also showed a significant reduction of injuries in the intervention group compared with an age- and skill-matched control group. [16]

S¨ oderman et al. [17] analysed the effects of balance board training in female players from the second and third national division. Seven teams were randomised  to  an  intervention  group  and  six  to  a  control group. The players of the intervention were given a balance board and a printed handout describing the programme and were instructed to perform the exercises at home in addition to their standard training. The  programme  consisted  of  five  exercises  with progressively  increasing  degrees  of  difficulty  and were performed initially each day for 30 days and then three times a week for the rest of the season. The  players  were  asked  to  record  the  amount  of balance board training in a special protocol. Twenty-seven players of the intervention group were excluded because they performed &lt;35 balance board sessions. Comparison of the intervention and control groups  showed  no  significant  differences  with  respect  to  the  incidence  of  traumatic  injuries  of  the lower extremities in general, severe knee injuries or ankle sprain.

In a recent review of 13 studies on the prevention of knee injuries in sports, [58] the investigators concluded that structured training programmes that emphasised neuromuscular and proprioceptive training offer  encouraging  evidence  for  the  prevention  of knee injuries.

## 4.3 Prevention of Ankle Sprains

Interventions  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  ankle sprains  in  soccer  players  have  been  evaluated  in three studies. [17-19] Tropp et al. [19]  compared the preventive  effect  of  ankle  disk  training  and  use  of orthoses in 25 male senior football teams followed up for 6 months. The teams were divided into three groups:  (i)  60  players  who  used  orthoses;  (ii)  65 players with previous ankle problems who took part in a coordination training programme performed on an ankle disk; and (iii) 171 players who served as controls.  Both  interventions  reduced  the  incidence of  ankle  sprains  among  players  with  a  history  of related problems to the same level as among players without any such history. The authors proposed the use of orthoses during the rehabilitation period, but also  state  that  ankle  disk  training  should  be  the method of choice in players with previous problems to prevent functional instability and recurrent ankle sprains.

Surve et al. [18] studied the preventive effect of a semi-rigid  orthosis  on  the  incidence  of  recurrent ankle sprains in male senior soccer players with and without previous ankle sprains during one playing season. Both groups were divided into an intervention and a control group. The players in the intervention group were provided with the orthoses and were instructed to wear them on the previously sprained or  the  dominant  ankle.  Compliance  was  strictly monitored by the coaches. The study showed that a semi-rigid orthosis had no effect in players without previous ankle sprains, but significantly reduced the incidence  of  ankle  sprains  in  the  players  with  a history of previous ankle sprains.

Reviews on the prevention of ankle sprains have similar results. [59-62] A recent Cochrane review [62] of interventions for preventing ankle ligament injuries concluded, from 14 randomised trials, that external ankle support in the form of semi-rigid orthoses or aircast braces can prevent ankle sprains during highrisk sporting activities such as soccer, especially in athletes  with  previous  ankle  sprains.  Participants with a history of previous sprains should be advised that wearing such supports reduces the risk of incurring a future sprain. From other interventions aimed specifically at the prevention of ankle sprains, proprioceptive/coordination training using ankle disks seems to be the most promising.

## 5. Conclusions

Summarising the scientific literature on the incidence of soccer injuries, it can be estimated that on average  every  elite  male  soccer  player  incurs  approximately  one  performance-limiting  injury  each year. For female players, only little epidemiological

data on injuries are available. Studies on the prevention of soccer injuries vary substantially in characteristics  of  the  study  population  and  the  type  of interventions. However, there is some evidence that multi-modal  intervention  programmes  result  in  a reduction  in  injuries  in  general.  Proprioceptive  or neuro-muscular  training  seems  to  prevent  severe knee injuries and recurrent ankle sprains. The use of semi-rigid  orthoses  should  be  recommended  for players with previous ankle sprains. However, more methodologically well-designed studies are required to evaluate the effects of specific preventive interventions. Future studies should monitor compliance with  the  programme  because  this  is  an  essential factor for its effectiveness. Prevention programmes probably have different effects in male and female players,  and  are  more  effective  in  groups  with  an increased risk of injury. Identification of high-risk groups may help to limit the cost and improve the effects of sports injury prevention programmes.
