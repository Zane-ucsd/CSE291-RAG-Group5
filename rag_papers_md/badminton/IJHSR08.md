## INTRODUCTION

The ankle joint is most commonly affected joint in sports in which lateral ankle sprains are  the  most  common.  A  systemic  review revealed  the  percentage  of  recurrent  ankle injury as ranging from 5%  to 73%  in badminton athletes 1 .

Chronic  ankle  instability  (CAI)  is  mostly found in athletes of ages between 18 and 25 years 1. CAI  usually  occurs  in  persons  with ankle  sprain if they do  not receive the appropriate  rehabilitation  training.  Due  to ankle  sprain,  the  ligaments,  tendons,  and also mechanoreceptors around the ankle

joint  are  injured.  These  lead  to  a  laxity  of the  injured  ligaments/tendons  and  impaired ankle proprioception, which affects the neuromuscular control of the ankle 2 . Individuals with CAI experience both mechanical and functional instability of the ankle joint 3 .

Pain,  swelling,  weakness,  instability,  and repeated episodes of ''giving way.'' 4 These residual symptoms can impede young patients' physical activity, which can negatively  affect  their  overall  health  and quality  of  life  by  leading  to  obesity  and other general health problems. Chronic ankle instability is defined as a history of at least 1 significant ankle sprain, giving way, recurrent sprain, and/or feelings of instability 5.

Persistence  of  such  instability  over  time increases  the  risk  of  articular  damage  and developing Osteoarthritis 6 . The cost of treating and preventing such injuries is very high that has a major effect on the athlete's training and return to play 7 .The main cause of  chronic  ankle  instability  that  have  been found are decreased proprioceptive abilities because loss of mechanoreceptor and decreased  muscle  strength  of  evertor  and invertor.

Balance  training  is  the  main  component  of rehabilitation  plans,  has  been  widely  used for patients with CAI 8 . Balance training can promote  the  recovery  of  motor  perception by  stimulating  the  receptors  of  the  ankle joint  capsule  and  ligaments,  increasing  the input of motor sensation and activating gamma motor neurons 9 .

Functional  performance  tests  are  dynamic measures used to assess general lower body function.  These  tests  are  helpful  because they combine multiple components, such as muscular strength, neuromuscular coordination and joint stability which could be affected after joint injury 5 .

Badminton game revolves around the speed and deception and abrupt jerking movement with  rapid  footwork.  This  combination  of repetitive maneuver places major stresses on lower  extremities  and  increases  the  risk  of chronic injuries.

This  study  aims  to  find  the  effect  of  ankle rehabilitation programs on balance and functional  ability  in  adolescent  badminton players with CAI.

The  objective  is  to  compared  the  pre  and post effect of ankle rehabilitation programs in  adolescent  badminton  players  using  Y  balance test, side hop test and FAAM scale.

## MATERIALS &amp; METHODS

Study design- Experimental (pre-post) Sample size- 43

Study population- 18 to 25 years old badminton players

Study duration- 4 weeks

Sampling method - convenient sampling Study  setting  - badminton  clubs  in  and around Pune

## Selection criteria: Inclusion criteria:

1. History of least 1 substantial ankle sprain

Strength training is important in rehabilitation.  Deficits  in  evertor  strength would reduce the ability of these muscle to resist  inversion  and  return  the  foot  to  the neutral position  and  thereby  prevent  the inversion sprain 10 . Not concentric but eccentric evertors weakness has been demonstrated in patients suffering from chronic  ankle  instability.  A  second  cause could  be  the  deep  peroneal  muscle  nerve dysfunction  as  a  result  of  over-stretching peroneal nerve 9,10 .

2. Multiple  episodes  of  the  ankle  ''giving way,'' recurrent sprain.
3. 'Feelings of instability'' in the 6 months before the study
4. Participant willing to participate
5. Both male and female badminton players
6. Age group 18-25 years

## Exclusion criteria:

1. An acute lower extremity injury in the 3 months before the study

2. Participants who are participated in rehabilitation in the 3 months before the study.
3. Participants  with  history  of  any  lower extremity surgery.
4. Participants  having  any  recent  of  lower extremity injury.
5. History of lower extremity fracture.
6. Individual with any neurological disorders

## PROCEDURE

Participants  were  selected  on  the  basis  of the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  The purpose of the study was explained to participants and written consent will be taken.  Participants  were  assured  regarding confidentiality of their information or collected data. Chronic ankle instability was assessed. Pre-Assessment by Y-balance test, side hop test and foot ankle ability measure scale were taken. Protocol was given to the participant. Post assessment was taken after 4 weeks. All the data was collected, analyzed and interpreted.

## Outcome measure:

## 1. DYNAMIC BALANCE TEST- Y balance test

A  dynamic balance test was performed using  the  Y-Balance  test  (YBT)  equipment (FMS TM, avoid  interference  from  the  environment. An  examiner  observed  from  behind the participants  to  avoid  distracting  them.  The length of the lower limb was measured from the anterior superior iliac bone to the middle of the medial ankle bone  using a tape measure  to  calculate  the  total  score.  The formula for calculating the total score is as follows: [(sum of the 3 distances)/(length of lower limb × 3)] × 100 (Inter  rated  reliability  ICC=0.88-0.99,  intra

reliability 0.85 to 1.00)

## FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE-

1.Side hop test

Patients  stood  on  their  involved  limb  and hopped 30 cm laterally, side to side, for 10 repetitions as fast as possible. A  single practice trial for patient familiarization was allowed  before  the  test  trials.  The  test  was conducted twice on the involved limb, with a  60-second  rest  provided  between  trials. The shortest trial was used for analysis

(ICC ranging from 0.92-0.97)

242.Foot and Ankle ability measure (FAAM) scale

Sport subscale-(ICC=0.87; SEM=4,5points) ADL  subscale:  (ICC  =  0.89;  SEM  =  2,1 points)

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Chatham, VA, USA) according to the recommended guidelines. The examiner demonstrated  the  YBT  and  provided  an explanation to the participants. Each participant's foot was placed on the examination table with one foot held in the center, to be extended to the anterior, posterior lateral, and posterior medial directions  as  far  as  possible.  The  healthy side was tested first, followed by the injured side. The examiner provided verbal instructions  and  signals  to  start.  Each  side was  tested  3  times,  and  the  highest  value was recorded. The recordings were made at 0.5-cm  increments.  If  the  foot  touched  the ground due to loss of balance, a retest was conducted after an explanation. The test was performed indoors under quiet conditions to

All data were analyzed with Microsoft excel and Graph Pad. The data pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test  of  normality  for all  the  data  hence  parametric  test  that  is paired t test used. Levels of significance was set at p value&lt;0.05.

## RESULT

In  this  study,  total  43  subjects,  both  male (86.04%)  and  female  (13.95%)  with  the mean age 21. Group was given ankle rehabilitation programme to improve balance and functional ability in adolescent badminton players, were selected using convenient sampling method. In intra-group analysis  (within  the  group)  for  Y-balance test  using  paired  t  test  was  done.  In  this study  pre  and  post  intervention  mean  and SD  score  was  for  anterior  direction  pre

score  (105.09  ±  10.954)  and  post  score (107.76  ±  11.032),  posteromedial  direction pre  score  (103.09±11.034)  and  post  score (105.39±10.946) and posterolateral direction  pre  score  (103.79  ±  11.803)  and post  score  (107.27±  11.89)  of  Y-  balance test. Intra group analysis for Y- balance test was revealed a significant difference between pre and post intervention (p≤0.0001). Thus, ankle rehabilitation programme was effective in improving balance in adolescent badminton players at the end of 4 weeks. In intra-group analysis (within  the  group)  for  Side  Hop  test  using paired t test was done. In this study pre and post  intervention  mean  and  SD  score  was pre  score  (36.65  ±  4.047)  and  post  score (40.20 ± 4.14) of Side Hop test. Intra group analysis  for  Side  Hop  test  was  revealed  a significant  difference  between  pre  and  post intervention (p≤0.0001). Thus, ankle rehabilitation  program  me  was  effective  in improving  functional  ability  in  adolescent badminton players at the end of 4 weeks. In intra-group  analysis  (within  the  group)  for FAAM Scale using paired t  test  was  done. In this study pre and post intervention mean and  SD  score  was  for  ADL  Sub-scale  pre score (70.32 ± 7.930) and post score (79.90 ± 6.229) and Sport sub-scale pre score (65.34  ±  9.429)  and  post  score  (81.37  ± 6.963) of FAAM Scale. Intra group analysis for FAAM Scale was revealed a significant difference between pre and post intervention in  both  sub-scale  (p≤0.0001).  Thus,  ankle rehabilitation  programme  was  effective  in improving  functional  ability  in  adolescent badminton players at the end of 4 weeks.

## DISCUSSION

The  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  find  the effectiveness of ankle rehabilitation programme on balance and functional ability in adolescent badminton players with chronic ankle instability (CAI).  It  has  been previously  studied  that  balance  deficit  and lack  of  strength  in  muscle  leads  to  ankle sprain. Lateral ankle sprain is most common musculoskeletal condition we see in badminton  players.  Recurrence  of  lateral ankle sprain causes chronic ankle instability. It has been also suggested that poor neuromuscular control, lack of balance training  and  strength  training  are  also  the contributing risk factors for the chronic ankle  instability  in  adolescent  badminton players as per the available literature. In our study we provide protocol to improve strength, balance and functional performance training in badminton players. The  study  conducted  by  Zhang.  C  et.al stated that prevalence of chronic ankle instability  in  adolescent  badminton  players is  ranging from 5% to 73%2. According to Mc  kay  GD  et.al  stated  that  out  of  all  the patients  56%  are  attributed  to  lateral  ankle sprains 13 .  In this study, total 43 numbers of subjects were included with the mean age of 21  years  by  convenient  sampling  method. Chronic ankle instability players were included  among  them  male  (86.04%)  and female (13.95%).

In  the  present  study,  baseline  treatment  to improve balance training exercises includes single legged stance, resistance band training  etc.  were  given  to  the  adolescent badminton  players.  The  Y-  balance  score shows that the players who performed specifically design balance training program have  better  result  in  improving  dynamic balance  and  strength  in  badminton  players affected by CAI.

Balance  training  improves  proprioception, neuromuscular control, and stability by stimulating sensory receptors, activating muscles  involved  in  maintaining  balance, and  promoting  adaptive  responses  in  the central nervous system. It involves exercises targeting visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems to enhance postural control and reduce the risk of falls.

Emily A. et. al has been proved that strength training  protocol  for  balance  deficits  was beneficial  in  chronic  ankle  instability 14 .  Its already  proven  in  the  previous  studies  that balance  and  strength  training  programme was effective in chronic ankle instability. In our study we gave the balance training and strength training exercises to the adolescent badminton players which found to be effective.

The  intrinsic  muscle  of  the  foot  works  as important  stabilizers.  As  well,  the  tibialis posterior is the main medial dynamic stabilizer of the ankle and also stabilizes the medial  longitudinal  arch  of  the  foot,  while the peroneus  longus  is the main  lateral dynamic  stabilizer  of  the  ankle.  Anterior talo-fibular  ligament  plays  major  role  in ankle  sprain,  injury  to  the  ligaments  of  the ankle results in adverse changes  to the neuromuscular system that provides dynamic  support  to  the  ankle.  Attributed impaired balance in individuals with lateral ankle sprains to damaged articular mechanoreceptors  in  the  lateral  ligaments which resulted in proprioceptive deficit.

In  chronic  ankle  instability  the  functional performance  of  the  players  was  affected. Joint injury results in proprioceptive decrements, which also leads to impairments in neuromuscular control. These  changes  limit  the  dynamic  defense system of the ankle and predispose the ankle to  recurrent  episodes  of  instability.  Altered muscle spindle activity, as mediated through the Y  motoneuron  system, may  be  the keystones to this interrelated symptom. The key to treating functional insufficiency may lie  in  restoration  of  normal  y  motoneuron activity.

Strengthening involves physiological process  like  muscles  hypertrophy,  where muscle fibers increase in size due to resistance training  which  occurs  through mechanism such as increased protein synthesis and recruitment of muscle fibers 5,6 .

In the present study the protocol was set to train  adolescent badminton players affected by  CAI,  which  results  in  poor  functional performance. Ankle rehabilitation programme to improve functional performance includes single-legged hop, steamboats,  hop  up  and  down  etc.  were given. In our study the result shows that the effect of these exercises in adolescent badminton  players  shows  significant  post rehabilitation  score  inside  hop  test  which concludes improved functional performance. Smash  is  technique  in  badminton  game, jumping and landing sequence is associated with  injury;  Badminton  requires  a  lot  of quick  changes  in  direction,  agility  jumps and landing so to prevent lateral ankle sprains it requires good functional performance in badminton players.

M. Spencer  et.al  stated  in  their  studies  that the provided ankle rehabilitation programme based on resistance band exercises and balance  board  exercises  were  effective  in improving  clinical  measures  of  functional and patient reported outcomes 4 .

Similar to the result of side hop test and Y balance test for functional performance and balance respectively the present study indicated  that  significant  difference  in  pre post FAAM scale (patient reported outcomes) in  adolescent  badminton  players with  CAI.  The  result  implies  that  ankle rehabilitation  programme  was  effective  in functional ability and reduction in functional  deficits  in  adolescent  badminton players.

Christopher  R.  et.  al  stated  in  their  study that FAAM  scale used to detect self reported  functional  deficit  in  athletes  with chronic ankle instability 15 . Hence, it is proved that the ankle rehabilitation  programme  was  effective  in adolescent  badminton  players  with  chronic ankle instability

## CONCLUSION

It  is  concluded  that  the  ankle  rehabilitation programme is effective in improving balance, strength and functional performance in badminton players with chronic ankle instability.
