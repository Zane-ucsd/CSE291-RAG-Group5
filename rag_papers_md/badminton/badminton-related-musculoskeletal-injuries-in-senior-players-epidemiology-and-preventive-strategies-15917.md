Badminton is a popular sport with numerous health benefits but carries the risk of injury. Limited research is available  on  badminton-related  injuries  among  senior  Asian  players.  This  cross-sectional  study  used  a questionnaire to gather data on demographics, exercise habits, injury history, injury mechanisms, affected body parts, symptoms, and injury severity from 254 participants. Most participants were male (70.6%), with a median age of 46 years (inter-quartile range [IQR] = 16.0). The median injury incidence was 4.3 per 1,000 hours played (IQR = 6.5). The most commonly injured body parts on the dominant side were the knees (51.1%), ankles (36.3%), and shoulders/clavicles  (25.5%).  On  the  non-dominant  side,  the  knee  (34.2%)  and  ankle  (25.5%)  were  frequently injured. The most common mechanism of knee and ankle injuries occurs during changes in direction. Common injuries included ankle sprains (23.5%), patellar tendinopathy (20.3%), and muscle cramps (31.6%). Most injuries (60.6%) were mild. Future studies should focus on comprehensive prevention methods to reduce injuries.

## INTRODUCTION

Badminton, recognized as the fastest racket sport with a record-breaking shuttlecock speed of 565 km/h [1], continues to hold its status as one of the world ' s most popular sports. It boasts over 700 million enthusiasts globally and has experienced a particularly significant surge in interest in Asia [2,  3].  It  is  the  third  most-followed  sport  in  more  than  20 countries, engaging 16% of sports fans. This level of engagement  is  impressive,  closely  following  football  and basketball, with fan bases of 35% and 17%, respectively. The expansive influence of social media continues to play a crucial role in enhancing global recognition and appeal of badminton. In Thailand, the surge in the popularity of badminton has been largely  due  to  the  success  of  prominent  players  who  have secured victories in international competitions [4].

It  has  been  proven  that  badminton  not  only  enhances physical health but also mental and social well-being across numerous age groups [5]. However, similar to other sports, it is also  associated  with  musculoskeletal  injuries.  Badminton injuries  make  up  approximately  1-5%  of  all  sports  injuries. According to previous studies, the risk of injuries in badminton is  approximately  0.9  injuries  per  annum  and  1-7  injuries  per 1,000 hours of play [6-8]. The lower limb is the most commonly affected  in  such  injuries,  with  an  estimated  58-92%  of  cases involving it. The knee is the most commonly injured part of the lower  limb,  followed  by  the  ankle,  with  common  injuries including strains,  sprains,  tendinopathy,  and  stress  fractures [7-9].  However,  with  most  injuries  categorized  as  mild  to moderate in terms of severity, at least 20% of schoolchildren missed at least one day of school in a given year due to sports injuries.  Furthermore,  it  was  estimated  that  one  in  three working adults lost at least one day per year because of injuries from sports-related activities [10].  Therefore,  comprehensive preventive strategies must be implemented to mitigate adverse outcomes. It was proposed a four-step model for injury prevention  [11].  This  model  begins  with  the  critical  step  of establishing the magnitude of the injury, followed by identifying the etiology and mechanisms of the injury. Subsequently, it involves the introduction of preventive measures  and  evaluation  of  their  effectiveness.  Population aging is a phenomenon that affects many countries worldwide, including those in Asia [12]. The population aged over 60 years increased from 5% in 1995 to 17.1% in 2017 and is projected to increase to 30% by 2035 [13]. This demographic shift has led to an  increase  in  the  number  of  elderly  patients  with  sportsrelated trauma, potentially increasing its morbidity and mortality [14]. To the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on badminton-related injuries, particularly among Asian senior players, encompassing both elite and nonelite levels [7, 15]. Understanding this could be instrumental in developing prevention strategies for vulnerable groups through routine exercise, training, and competition.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Participants

The  study  was  conducted  between  November  2023  and June 2024. The inclusion criteria were an age range of 35-85 years, Thai nationality, and regular participation in badminton (at least 2 hours per week for a minimum of 12 months). The exclusion  criteria  were  unwillingness  to  participate  in  the study; incomplete responses; a medical history of disabilities related to vision, hearing, speech, motor, or physical functions; mental or  behavioral  health;  autism;  intellectual  abilities;  or learning disorders.

## Questionnaires and Study Design

The questionnaire was modified with permission based on the study in [16]. This revision was carried out in consultation with experts, including orthopedic physicians, sports medicine specialists, and badminton coaches. The questionnaire gathered comprehensive data, including demographic information  such  as  sex,  age,  weight,  height,  preexisting medical  conditions, and  educational background.  Details regarding exercise habits, injury history, mechanisms of injury, affected body parts, symptoms, and severity of injuries were also  collected.  All  assessment  measures  were  thoroughly reviewed and validated by two sports science experts utilizing the  index  of  item  objective  congruence  (IOC).  An  IOC  index score  exceeding  0.5  affirmed  the  content  validity  of  the questionnaire  [17].  Prior  to  the  initiation  of  the  study,  the preliminary  questionnaires  were  pilot  tested  with  30  adult volunteers at the Walailak Sports Center and adjustments were made to clarify ambiguous wording. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated by calculating the Cronbach ' s  alpha  coefficient  with  a  value  of  0.70  or  higher deemed acceptable [18]. A one-time questionnaire was distributed online using Google Forms to collect data. Cochran ' s sample size formula was utilized [19]:

Based on the results reported in [20], the specific parameter set for this calculation included a confidence level of 90%, margin of error of 0.05, and a prevalence rate of 0.36. The initial calculations yielded a sample size of 250 individuals. However, to accommodate the potential 5% rate of incomplete data, the sample size was revised to 262. This study complied with  the  principles  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  the International  Conference  on  Harmonization  of  Good  Clinical Practice.  The  study  was  registered  in  the  Thai  Clinical  Trials Registry (TCTR20231110008).

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical data analysis was conducted by calculating the frequency,  percentage,  mean,  median,  standard  deviation (SD), and inter-quartile range (IQR), and comparing the data (in the  case  of  subgroup  analysis).  To  determine  associations between continuous variables and ordinal data, you can use Spearman ' s  rank  correlation  coefficient  (Spearman ' s  rho, ρ ). This nonparametric test measures the strength and direction of  the  association  between  two  ranked  variables,  making  it suitable  for  evaluating  the  relationship  between  continuous and  ordinal  variables.  To  compare  the  values  of  the  two independent sample groups, we used either an independent ttest  or  the  Mann-Whitney  U  test,  depending  on  the  data distribution.  To  determine  associations  between  variables, Pearson ' s correlation (r) was applied for continuous variables, while  Spearman ' s  rho  ( ρ )  was  used  for  ordinal  data  and  for associations between continuous variables and ordinal data. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## RESULTS

After distributing the questionnaire, we received a 74.3% response  rate.  Six  participants  were  excluded  because  they chose not to disclose their data or decided not to participate in the  study,  resulting  in  254  participants  included  in  the  final analysis. Most patients were male (n = 180, 70.6%). Median age was 46 years (IQR = 16.0), weight 68.5 kg (IQR = 15.0), height 168 cm (IQR = 10.0), and BMI 23.8 (IQR = 3.8). The following numbers of participants graduated with less than a bachelor ' s degree, bachelor ' s degree, master ' s degree, and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD):  37  (14.5%),  125  (49.0%),  64  (25.1%),  and  28  (11.0%), respectively. Most participants were right-handed (230, 90.6%) and  had  a  dominant  right  leg  (223,  87.8%).  In  the  jumping posture,  the  participants  took  off  from  the  floor  with  their dominant leg (45.7%), non-dominant leg (21.3%), and both legs (33.1%). In the landing posture, they landed on their dominant leg (49.2%), non-dominant leg (20.1%), and both legs (30.7%). The reasons for playing badminton were recreational activity (75.6%),  regional  competition  (16.5%),  national  competition (6.3%), and international competition (1.6%).

The median duration of playing badminton was 13.0 years (IQR = 17.3). The median frequency of play was 3.0 times per week (IQR = 2.0), and the median duration per session was 2.0 hours (IQR = 1.0). The median duration of on-court training was 9.0 hours  per  week  (IQR  =  17.0),  and  off-court  training, including strength and endurance exercises, was 1.0 hour per week  (IQR  =  4.0).  They  reported  warming  up  before  playing badminton,  as  follows:  never  (0.8%),  sometimes  (36.2%), mostly (31.5%), and always (31.5%). The median warm-up time was 7.5 minutes (IQR = 5.0). Among those who warmed up, the specific areas targeted were the hands (77.6%), arms/shoulders (94.5%), neck (48.8%), back (55.9%), hips/legs (77.6%), and feet (74.4%). Only 37.4% reported warming in all parts  of  the  body.  Regarding  cooling  down,  participants reported the following frequencies: never (5.5%), sometimes (44.1%), mostly (26.0%), and always (24.4%). The median cooldown  time  was  7.5  minutes  (IQR  =  5.6).  Among  those  who cooled  down,  the  specific  areas  targeted  were  the  hands (51.2%), arms/shoulders (82.7%), neck (40.9%), back (66.9%), hips/legs  (82.3%),  and  feet  (58.7%).  Only  28.3%  reported cooling down all parts of the body.

## Injury Profile

Of the participants, 196 (77.2%) had experienced badminton-related injuries in the past year, with 394 reported injuries (292 in men, 102 in women). The median incidence of injuries was 4.3 injuries per 1,000 hours played (IQR = 6.5). Men experienced a median of 4.4 injuries per 1,000 hours (IQR 6.3), while women experienced a median of 4.1 injuries per 1,000 hours (IQR = 7.8). There was  no statistically significant difference in the incidence of injuries between the sexes (p = 0.595). These injuries were diagnosed by their coach (43.7%) and medical staff (33.9%); the remaining 22.4% were identified by  the  participants  themselves.  The  details  of  badmintonrelated injuries in the past year are shown in Table 1 .

## Regarding Pain

Among  the  injured  participants,  94  (48.0%)  experienced pain in the same region as their actual injury on most days of the previous month. Additionally, 39 (19.9%) participants had experienced  pain  in  a  different  region  for  most  days  in  the previous month. The other most common regions included the lower back (8.2%), knee (5.6%), and shoulder/clavicle (4.6%). A total  of  134  participants  (68.4%)  still  experienced  pain  upon returning to partial practice, whereas 124 (63.3%) experienced pain upon returning to full practice. In addition, 78 participants (39.8%)  experienced  pain  upon  returning  to  their  matches. Notably, 168 participants (85.7%) had a previous injury of the same  type  as  the  current  injury.  The  severity  of  pain  and participant management of pain are shown in Table 3 .

## Correlation Analysis of Injury Frequency and Participant Characteristics

Pearson ' s correlation was used to determine the relationship between the frequency of injuries and the participants ' characteristics using continuous data. Our analysis found no significant association between the frequency of injuries and age (r = -0.015, p = 0.818), weight (r = 0.072, p = 0.254), BMI (r = 0.086, p = 0.170), duration of playing badminton (r = 0.062, p = 0.323), warm-up duration (r = -0.113, p  =  0.073),  and  cool-down  duration  (r  =  -0.064,  p  =  0.306). Spearman ' s  rho  was  used  to  determine  the  relationship between the frequency of injuries and participant characteristics  measured  using  ordinal  data.  There  was  no significant association between the frequency of injuries and the  purpose  of  playing  badminton.  However,  there  was  a significant inverse association between  the  frequency  of injuries and the frequency of warm-up ( ρ = -0.273, p &lt; 0.001), as well as between the frequency of injuries and the frequency of cool-down ( ρ = -0.238, p &lt; 0.001).

## DISCUSSION

Badminton is a sport that can cause injuries, although most are not caused by body-to-body contact [6, 21]. This may result in  increased  morbidity  and  mortality,  particularly  in  older populations [14]. Understanding the incidence and mechanisms of  injuries  can  be  beneficial  for  planning  injury prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity  of  studies  focusing  on  badminton-related  injuries, particularly among Asian senior players. Our findings demonstrated that approximately 77% of the participants had experienced badminton-related injuries in the past year. The incidence  of  injuries  was  approximately  4  injuries  per  1,000 hours played. The most commonly affected body parts were the knee and ankle, regardless of the dominant or nondominant side. The mechanism  of these injuries is associated  with  changing  direction  while  playing.  Forehand smashes are the most common badminton shots that cause injuries. However, most injuries were classified as minor and required  less  than  one  week  for  recovery.  Common  pain management methods include massage, oral analgesics, and physical rehabilitation.

The epidemiology of badminton  injuries is not well documented and there is a lack of data in Thailand, particularly among  senior  players,  given  the  country ' s  aging  population [20, 22]. It was analyzed 44 badminton athletes in Hong Kong [23]. The overall incidence of injuries was 5.04 per 1,000 player hours. The highest incidence was among elite senior athletes (7.38),  followed  by  elite  junior  athletes  (5.03),  and  potential athletes (2.07). Elite senior athletes had a higher incidence of recurrent injuries, whereas elite junior athletes and potential athletes  had  higher  incidences  of  new  injuries.  Most  new injuries were strains (n = 80), with the most frequently injured body  sites  being  the  back  (21.3%),  shoulder  (18.8%),  thigh (18.8%), and knees (18.8%). It was conducted a retrospective case review in Malaysia [24]. Over a period of 2.5 years, a total of 469 musculoskeletal injuries were diagnosed. Of these, 276 (58.8%) injuries occurred in badminton players aged &lt; 20 years old.  The  majority  of  injuries,  406  (86.6%)  occurred  during training or practice sessions, while only eight (1.7%) occurred during competitions. Overuse injuries were the most common type  of  injuries  diagnosed  at  NSI  clinics.  In  terms  of  injury severity,  429  (91.5%)  were  mild,  7  (1.5%)  moderate,  and  33 (7.0%) severe. Most injuries (296 or 63.1%) affected the lower extremities,  with  the  knee  being  the  most  common  location (37.1%),  followed  by  the  ankle  (28.3%),  thigh  (13.2%),  heel (11.2%), toes (5.7%), and other areas (4.4%). It was performed a prospective study in Malaysia involving  69  adolescent badminton  players  over  a  one-year  period  [25].  During  this period, 63 injuries were recorded, resulting in an incidence of 1.09  injuries  per  player  per  year  and  0.9  injuries  per  1,000 training hours. The lower limbs were predominantly affected (69.8%),  with  the  knee  being  the  most  common  injury  site, followed  by  the  back,  spine,  and  ankles.  Most  injuries  were considered mild, with approximately 30% of players returning to  play  within  one  week.  It  was  conducted  a  prospective longitudinal  survey  in  Japan  that  included  133  badminton players from junior high schools, high schools, and universities who  competed  at  the  national  tournament  level  [26].  The distribution  of  injury  severity  was,  as  follows:  slight  (83.8%), minimal  (4.1%),  mild  (3.4%),  moderate  (6.8%),  and  severe (1.9%). The injury rate per player per 1,000 h ranged from 0.9 to 5.1. The injury rate during practice was significantly higher in women than in men and increased with age. It was conducted a  12-month  prospective  cohort  study  in  France  involving  20 elite international players [27]. They documented a total of 35 injuries, corresponding to an incidence of 3.4 injuries per 1,000 hours of play, with 11.6 injuries per 1,000 hours of play during competition.  Most  injuries  were  lower  limb  injuries  (54.3%),

whereas upper limb injuries  were  less  frequent  (37.1%).  The foot was the most frequently affected location in lower limb injuries. The most common location of upper limb injuries was the shoulder, accounting for 38.5% of upper limb injuries and 14.3% of all injuries, with rotator cuff tendinopathies comprising 80% of shoulder injuries. The smash was the shot with  the  highest  risk  of  upper  limb  injuries  (46.2%),  and  the lunge  was  the  footwork  with  the  highest  risk  of  lower  limb injuries  (31.6%).  It  was  performed  a  retrospective  study  in France involving 135 emergency department patients, totaling 140 admissions and 146 injuries [28]. The majority were male (73, 54.1%) with a mean age of 28 ± 13.8 years. Most injuries (88.3%) affected the lower limbs, followed by the upper limbs (11%)  and  the  head  (0.7%).  Sprains  were  the  most  common type of injury (60.9%), followed by tendino-muscular injuries (21.9%), fractures (8.9%), dislocations (3.4%), painful contusions  (2.1%), meniscal  injuries  (2.1%),  and  wounds (0.7%). Lateral ankle sprains were the most frequent lower limb injury (43.4%), followed by Achilles tendon ruptures (13.9%), tennis  leg  injuries  (8.5%),  and  mid-foot  sprains  (6.9%).  Our findings align with the aforementioned studies, as our incidence  data  were  at  the  upper  end  of  the  previously reported range -4.2 injuries per 1,000 hours, where the incidence  from  previous  studies  ranged  from  0.9  to  5.1. Similarly,  the  most  commonly  affected  site  is  the  lower extremities [24, 25, 27, 28].

According  to  our  findings,  the  knees  and  ankles  are  the most commonly affected body parts, particularly when changing direction during play. This emphasizes the importance  of  high-quality  footwork  in  badminton  [29,  30]. Effective  badminton  footwork  relies  on  several  key  factors including  strength,  agility,  flexibility,  balance,  coordination, and reaction time [31, 32]. All major leg muscles, including the gluteus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius, are involved  in  badminton  footwork,  particularly  the  lunge  and landing techniques  [33]. This may  explain  the prevalent involvement of these two joints in common injuries as they are directly  associated  with  the  aforementioned  muscles.  While lunges are a fundamental movement and an essential skill in badminton that enhances court coverage and shot execution [34, 35], they carry the risk of lower limb injuries because of the complexity  of  executing  an  effective lunge  [36].  Lunging generates significant vertical and horizontal forces, leading to high  joint  torque,  especially  at  the  knee.  These  forces  are especially pronounced during extreme lunges and can contribute to injuries, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and patellar tendinosis [34, 37].

It  investigated  the  biomechanics  of  three  badmintonspecific lunges: kick, step-in, and hop [39]. They found that the step-in  lunge  has  lower  horizontal  reaction  force  at  drive-off and lower peak hip joint power compared to the kick lunge, suggesting it may reduce muscle fatigue. Conversely, the hop lunge  exhibited  higher  reaction  forces  and  peak  ankle  joint moments and powers than the other lunges. It was recommended mastering the lunge technique, which includes forceful  knee  extension  with  internal  rotation,  ankle  muscle strengthening,  and  optimal  joint  coordination,  to  prevent injury. Muscle fatigue may contribute to increased injury risks [30].  It  significantly  affects  the  biomechanics  of  badminton athletes, particularly the range of motion (ROM) in the hip and ankle  joints.  A  reduction  in  hip  ROM  elevates  the  risk  of adductor and abductor injuries. While muscle fatigue does not substantially impact ankle ROM, it still alters lunge and landing biomechanics, thereby increasing  the  risk  of  posture-related injuries  [40].  It  was  found  that  while  fatigued,  there  was  a significant increase in ankle inversion at foot strike (+2.6°) and peak ankle inversion (+2.5°) [41]. Additionally, electromyography pre-activation within 100 milliseconds (ms) before  foot  landing  decreased  significantly  in  the  soleus  (23.4%), gastrocnemius lateralis (-12.2%), gastrocnemius medialis  (-23.3%),  and  peroneus  brevis  (-17.4%).  As  muscle fatigue impairs coordination and increases stress, potentially leading to injuries, the step-in-lunge technique may  be beneficial for reducing the muscular demands  of  lunge recovery, thereby minimizing muscle fatigue [38]. In addition, effective fatigue management  through a well-structured recovery  plan  and  balanced  training  is  essential  to  prevent muscle fatigue, poor performance, and injury risks [42].

According to [43], a stiffer landing technique significantly increases the risk of developing overuse and acute lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. The problematic techniques identified include a heel-strike position, greater ankle inversion, greater knee dynamic abduction, reduced hip flexion angle, higher external hip rotation strength, and reduced hip abduction strength. Players with ACL injuries had hip flexion angles  below  20 o at  initial  contact,  which  were  significantly more common in females compared to males [44]. In addition, injured  athletes  exhibited  significantly  lower  hip  abduction strength and higher external hip rotation strength compared to non-injured  athletes,  suggesting  that  reduced  hip  abduction strength  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  ACL  injury  [45]. According to knee biomechanics, reduced knee flexion angle ( ≤ 20 o )  at  initial contact and greater knee moments are key risk factors for knee injuries, while a higher peak knee flexion angle decreases this risk [46]. Increasing dynamic knee valgus angle is  a  critical  factor  in  knee  injury  during  landing.  Players  with knee  injuries  exhibited  an  8.4 o greater  knee  valgus  angle  at initial contact and significant increases in peak knee abduction moment, significantly elevating the risk of knee injuries [47]. Regarding ankle biomechanics, the injured player landed in a heel-strike  position  with  a  mean  dorsiflexion  of  2 o at  initial contact and transitioned to a flat-foot position over the next 20 ms,  increasing  the  plantarflexion  angle  by  an  average  of  12 o [48].  Moreover,  ankle  inversion  during  landing  significantly increases the risk of lateral ankle injuries, which account for over 80% of such injuries [49]. This inward rotation of the ankle can  damage  the  lateral  collateral  ligaments,  particularly  the anterior tibiofibular and  calcaneofibular ligaments. Ankle sprains are more likely when the ankle is in greater inversion.

To our knowledge, no comprehensive guidelines exist for preventing lower limb injuries in badminton. It was identified several effective preventive strategies, including biomechanical evaluations, which reduced the injury rate from 20.0% to 18.0%; customized warm-up routines, which lowered the rate from 34.5% to 20.0%; and recuperation management, such as ensuring adequate rest and therapy, which decreased the rate from 32.0% to 19.0% [50]. Safe lunge-landing biomechanics  include several key elements. Proper foot positioning, where the foot lands flat or on the forefoot [48], helps  reduce  impact  forces  on  the  joints.  Controlled  ankle inversion is crucial to minimize excessive inward rotation and prevent ankle sprains [49]. Maintaining good knee flexion [51] and alignment [52] ensures that the knee aligns with the toes, reducing  strain  on  the  knee  ligaments,  particularly  the  ACL. Adequate hip flexion [44] helps absorb landing forces, thereby reducing the load on the knee and ankle joints. Additionally,

strong and coordinated muscle activation across the hip, knee, and  ankle  joints  stabilizes  these  areas  and  absorbs  impact forces  effectively.  Finally,  balanced  force  distribution  across the  lower  limb  joints  prevents  overloading  any  single  joint, thereby  reducing the risk of  overuse injuries. It is also important to avoid landing with a heel-strike position, excessive  ankle  inversion,  greater  knee  dynamic  abduction, inadequate  hip  flexion  angle,  higher  external  hip  rotation strength,  and  insufficient  hip  abduction  strength  to  further reduce injury risks [43]. Prevention training programs, therefore, should focus on hip abductor strength, core stability, knee stability, and proper ankle positioning during landing to reduce injury risks. Additionally, neuromuscular activities such as warm-up exercises, plyometrics, and balance training have proven effective in reducing lower extremity injuries. Warm-up exercises  have  been  shown  to  reduce  perceived  muscle soreness  after  exercise  and  prevent  exercise-related  injuries [51,  53].  Integrating  both  static  and  dynamic  stretching  can improve flexibility, reduce muscle stiffness, and lower the risk of acute muscle injuries [54]. In contrast, active cool down does not  appear  to  diminish  the  long-term  adaptive  response  or prevent injury [52]. Our findings show that only one-third of the participants  always  warmed  up  before  playing  badminton, which  may  explain  the  high  incidence  of  injuries  observed. Emphasizing the importance of warm-ups is crucial for senior players. Sport-specific plyometric exercises not only improve change-of-direction  speed,  enhance  agility,  muscle  strength, and overall performance but also play a crucial role in injury prevention [55, 56]. Proprioceptive training programs significantly enhance neuromuscular control and joint stability,  effectively  reducing  the  incidence  of  ankle  injuries. The program benefits all athletes, regardless of their history with ankle sprains [57]. Finally, It was found that match play imposes  greater  and  less  predictable  strain  on  players  than practice  [58].  To  help  players  avoid  injuries,  incorporating match-like drills in training can help athletes adapt to the high demands of competition.

The strength of this study lies in its large sample size, which includes  senior  badminton  players.  However,  this  study  has several limitations. First, as this was a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, participants may have had inaccurate  recollections  and  misunderstandings,  leading  to inconsistent  data.  Additionally,  lengthy  questionnaires  can cause participant fatigue and reduce response quality. Second, this  study focused on the musculoskeletal injuries related to badminton. Patients with injuries to other organs, such as the eyes,  were  not  included.  Further  research  is  necessary  to identify  the  incidence  and  severity  of  these  injuries  and develop effective injury prevention plans. Third, although our study  identified  the  knee  and  ankle  as  the  most  commonly affected  body  parts,  particularly  during  direction  changes  in play, we recognize the need for more comprehensive preventive strategies against these injuries. We are optimistic that  future  studies  focusing  on  comprehensive  methods  will help fill this knowledge gap and improve the prevention and minimization of badminton-related injuries.

## CONCLUSIONS

The knees and ankles are the most commonly injured body parts on the dominant side, irrespective of whether they are on the dominant or non-dominant side. Both types of injuries are frequently  associated  with  direction  changes  during  play.

There  was  a  significant  inverse  association  between  the frequency of injuries and warm-up and cool-down exercises. Most injuries were mild in severity. Common pain management strategies  include  massage,  oral  analgesics,  and  physical rehabilitation.  Landing  with  a  heel-strike  position,  excessive ankle inversion, greater knee dynamic abduction, reduced hip flexion angle, higher external hip rotation strength, and lower hip  abduction  strength  can  increase  the  risk  of  lower  limb injuries.  Future  studies  focusing  on  comprehensive  methods are essential to fill this knowledge gap and enhance prevention and reduction of badminton-related injuries.
