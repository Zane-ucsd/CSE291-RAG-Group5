## ABSTRACT

Purpose: to detect the mechanisms for shoulder pain and injury during forehand overhead stroke using the questionnaire and 2D video analysis. Methods and Materials: Participants were 48 university badminton players (aged 18-22) with national tournament level who had no current shoulder injuries. A questionnaire investigation and a forehand overhead clear test were performed. The angle of arm slot at the moment of hit was calculated from 2D videos analysis using Image J software. Data were compared between badminton players with shoulder problems and those without. Results: There were 6 badminton players reported a history of shoulder injury that all of them were offen -sive players. 11 badminton players (8 offensive players and 3 defensive players) reported present shoulder pain that offensive players showed 7.33 times more likely to sustain present shoulder pain than defensive players (OR = 7.33, 95%CI: 1.55-34.70, p = 0.007; Fisher's Exact test: p = 0.012). Moreover, offensive players with present shoulder pain had significantly greater score of VAS (visual analog scale) than defensive players (74.0 mm ± 14.2 mm vs 44.6 mm ± 24.4 mm, p = 0.04). Significant differenc -es of arm slot angle were found among badminton players with shoulder pain free, history of shoulder injury and present shoulder pain (35.74o ± 4.85 o vs 42.90 o ± 11.89 o vs 37.81 o ± 6.40 o , F = 3.27, p = 0.047). Conclusion: Offensive badminton players are more likely to suffer from shoulder injury and strong intensity of shoulder pain. Greater arm slot angle of hit phase might be the mechanism leading to shoulder problems in badminton players. For improving shoulder re-injury prevention and rehabilitation protocols, our findings should be taken into consideration by physiotherapists, physicians and coaches.

Shoulder pain and injury are common  in badminton players  mostly  caused  by  forehand overhead stroke. Badminton forehand overhead stroke is recognized as the fundamental and the most typical skill requiring joint coordination and balance  ability  to  perform  body  core  mass shifting,  trunk  rotation  and  upper  limb  rotation simultaneously [1,2] . Improper (poor or inexperienced) forehand overhead motions producing abnormal biomechanics that not only negatively affect overhead motion performance, but  also  lead  to  injuries [3,4] .  Conventionally, forehand  overhead  stroke  is  divided  into  four phases,  that  is,  preparation,  acceleration,  hit, and follow-through (Fig. 1A).

The phase of the preparation takes approximately three quarters of one second to perform the motions as following: (1) moving the center of gravity followed by the dominant side leg step in a posterior and  slightly lateral direction,  (2)  the  shoulder  is  extended  and adducted and the wrist is extended leading to the racket-head  to  point  upward,  (3)  pointing  the nondominant  hand  toward  the  shuttlecock  to sustain  the  balance  posture. Acceleration  is  a highly dynamic phase consisting of a backswing and a forward swing.  Two factors of the acceleration phase dominate the effects of hit: (1) adequate performance of the backswing forward swing which need players perform weight shift, trunk rotation, racket-head backswing, shoulder adduction  and  forearm  rotation  smoothly  and simultaneously, (2)  the  length  of  the  kinematic chain at the moment of hitting the shuttlecock. From  preparation  to  hit,  upper  limb  muscles, such as biceps brachii, triceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis and  flexor  carpi  ulnaris,  were activated. At a constant time before the phase of hit, the peak electromyographic amplitude appears  in  the  triceps  brachii,  extensor  carpi radialis,  flexor  carpi  ulnaris  and  trapezius [5] .

After the hit, players perform the follow-through phase to dissipate excess momentum by crossing the racket to the contralateral side while swing the rear foot to the front foot  [2,6,7] .

Poor overhead motion techniques are regarded as mechanisms to increase injury risk in overhead motion sports.  A study of tennis revealed  that  compared  with  tennis  players without  shoulder  injury  history,  tennis  players with shoulder injury history had significantly less humeral abduction angle at the end of acceleration during serve  [8] . Studies of baseball showed that baseball pitchers with greater arm slot  angle  at  the  instant  of  ball  release,  or improper trunk rotation  sequence  might  be vulnerable to shoulder injuries  [9,10] .

As for badminton players, our previous studies showed that training hours of per day, decreased trunk rotation and weak balance ability were risk factors for shoulder pain  [11,12] . Although previous badminton  studies  adopted  biomechanics  to examine forehand overhead stroke motion [5,13,14] , no studies on the association of forehand overhead  stroke  motion  phases  and  shoulder pain  and  injury  were  found. Additionally,  video analysis  has  high  reliability  to  evaluate  sports motor skills, including phases of overhead motion [15,16] , however, such studies of badminton were scarce.

Proper  forehand  overhead  stroke  techniques and  coaching  approaches  are  important  for coaches and badminton players to decrease the joint loading and possibly prevent and rehabilitate  upper  limb  injuries  and  pain.  The purpose of this study was to detect the mechanisms for shoulder pain and injury during forehand overhead stroke using the questionnaire asking the characteristics and the type of  player  (offensive/defensive)  and  2D video analysis.

## Methods

## Participants

52 university badminton players (26 males and 26 females) belonging to Kanto University Badminton  Association were recruited from August  2018  to  March  2019.  This  study  was approved by Ethical Committee of the Graduate School  of Arts  and  Sciences,  the  University  of Tokyo, Japan (Notification Number 602-2 July 26, 2018). All the design complied with the declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent forms written by all the participants have been obtained.

## Questionnaire and badminton test

A self-reported questionnaire asked for baseline consisting of gender, age, height, weight, dominant hand, years of badminton experienced playing, training hours of per day, training days of per week, warm-up, injury/pain histories related to badminton, types of players (offensive players or defensive players), and playing categories (single, double or both).

A forehand overhead clear test was performed after  warm-up  to  examine  the  arm  slot  angle (angle of  the arm relative  to  the  ground  at the instant  of  hit  a  shuttlecock)  (Fig.  1B)  and  was recorded using a high speed  digital video camera with 240 frame per second slow motion model  (FDR-AX700,  Sony,  Japan).  2D  video analysis of overhead motion has been demonstrated  high  reliability  using  Image  J software for two-dimensional joint and segment angles  analysis [16] .  The  arm  slot  angle  was digitized using Image J software. The instant of hit was identified as the first frame in which the shuttlecock contacted the racket. The arm slot angle  was  calculated  by  a  research  assistant who  did  not  have  playing/coaching  badminton experience,  but  was  trained  to  measure  the angle. The high speed digital video camera was placed in the middle area of the court to enable the  forehand  overhead  stroke  to  be  recorded. The bubble level  of  tripod  and  the  grid  on  the camera video display were used to ensure that the camera was level. A badminton racket with a higher tension of 28 lb was used. The shuttlecocks with an international speed metric of 3/77 were selected. Due to the requirement of the  reproducible  serve  for  forehand  overhead clear test, the serve was performed by the same badminton  players.  Three  trials  for  forehand overhead clear were performed by the participants using maximal power. Mean arm slot angle of three trials of forehand overhead stroke was used to analyze. After forehand overhead clear test, all the participants were asked immediately  'Do  you  have  any  shoulder  pain during the forehand overhead stroke?'. If 'yes', the participants were also asked 'Please record the location of shoulder pain (anterior, outside or posterior), and mark pain intensity in the visual analog  scale  (VAS)'  and  'Which  phases  of forehand overhead stroke motor skill (preparation, acceleration, hit and follow-through) caused your shoulder pain?'

## Definition of injury and pain

For  keeping  consistency  in  the  definitions  and enabling  data  across  studies  to  be  compared, the definitions of sports injury published by IOC (International Olympic Committee)  [17]  were used to make the judgement criteria in this study. An injury  was  defined  as  any  physical  complaint sustained  during  badminton  match  or  training causing  one  or  more  of  the  three  judgement criteria  as  follows: (1) have to stop the current badminton  match  or  training  immediately,  (2) cannot presence in subsequent badminton match  or training, and  (3) require  medical attention  irrespective  of  the  potential  absence from match or training. Pain was defined as any physical  painful  complaint  or  discomfort  with sustained badminton capacity. Participants with

lacking data were excluded.

## Statistical methods

SPSS and R software were adopted for statistical analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine normality of baseline data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test was used for statistical analysis on  groups  (pain  free  group,  injury  group  and present pain group). Comparisons of the prevalence of shoulder pain between categorial variables  were  analyzed  using χ 2 test  and Fisher's  exact  test.  Mann-Whitney  U-test  was used to detect present shoulder pain intensities between different player types. Comparisons of the differences between offensive and defensive players without shoulder problems were analyzed using independent samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney  U-test.  For  statistical  analysis, the level of significance was set as below 0.05.

## Results

After excluding lacking data (n = 4), 48 participants  of  24  males  and  24  females  were included in this study. All the participants' dominant sides were right sides. Among all the participants, 22 participants were offensive players while the rest of the 26 participants were defensive  players.  31  participants  without  any shoulder pain were divided into pain free group, while 6 participants with shoulder injury experience were divided into injury group and 11 participants  with  present  shoulder  pain  were divided into  present pain  group. The results of baseline parameters are shown in Table 1 and 2. Table  1  shows  that  6  injured  players  were  all offensive  players.  Using  χ 2   test  and  Fisher's exact test for categorical variables analysis, we found that the participants with history of shoulder pain showed 13.846 times more likely to sustain present shoulder pain (OR = 13.846, 95%CI: 1.572-121.985, p = 0.005, Fisher's Exact test: p =  0.006)  than  those  without.  Moreover, compared  with defensive players, offensive players showed 7.3 times more likely to sustain present  shoulder  pain  (OR  =  7.333,  95%CI: 1.550-34.695, p = 0.007; Fisher's Exact test: p = 0.012).  VAS  score  of  present  shoulder  pain analyzed  by  Mann-Whitney  U-test  in  offensive players  was  stronger  than  defensive  players (74.0 mm ± 14.2 mm vs 44.6 mm ± 24.4 mm, p = 0.04). Additionally, among the 11 players with present  shoulder  pain,  3  players  reported  the phase  of  acceleration  causing  pain,  7  players reported hit and 1 player reported hit and followthrough. 5 cases located in outside shoulder, 2 cases  in  posterior  shoulder  and  4  cases  in anterior shoulder.

For  the  three  groups  analyzed  by  one-way ANOVA, there were no significant differences of age,  height,  weight,  BMI,  years  of  badminton experience, training hours of per day, days of per week and total training hours of per week among pain free, injury and present pain groups (Table 2).  For  arm  slot  angle  analyzed  by  one-way ANOVA, significant differences were found among the three groups (pain free vs injury vs present pain: 35.74 o  ± 4.85 o vs 42.90 o ± 11.89 o vs 37.81 o ±  6.40 o ,  F  =  3.27, p =  0.047).  With Post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni test, significant  differences  were  found  in  arm  slot angle between pain free group and injury group ( p =  0.046).  Additionally,  data  of  badminton players without shoulder problems broken down by  type  of  player  (9  offensive  players  and  22 defensive players) were also analyzed (Table 3). There were significant differences of age, weight and BMI between offensive and defensive players  while  no  other  significant  differences were found. Offensive players showed a tendency to significantly greater arm slot angle compared  with defensive players (offensive players vs defensive players: 38.19 o  ± 4.18 o  vs

34.74 o  ± 4.83 o , p = 0.07).

## Discussion

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first study  to  identify  the  mechanisms  of  forehand overhead motion with shoulder pain and injury in badminton players. In this study, some vital and special findings were found: (1) type of offensive badminton players was a risk factor of shoulder pain and injury, (2) offensive badminton players showed significantly stronger shoulder pain than defensive  badminton  players,  and  (3)  greater arm slot angle of the phase of the hit might be the  mechanism  of  shoulder  pain  and  injury  in elite  university badminton players with national tournament level.

Shoulder pain not only affects overhead motion performance negatively, but disturbs activity of daily  living  in  overhead  motion  sports  athletes [9,18-20] .  Previous studies have studied shoulder pain in recreational and world-class badminton players,  however,  no  risk  factors  were  found [18,19] . Although type of player has been studied in the previous studies, no significant differences of incidence of shoulder pain were found between offensive badminton players and defensive badminton  players. In this study, offensive badminton players showed significantly  higher  incidence  of  shoulder  pain compared  with  defensive  badminton  players which is inconsistent with the previous studies. Badminton  players  required  medical  attention were categorized as shoulder injury group in this study whereas the previous studies categorized 50%  badminton  players  with shoulder pain required  medical  attention  as  shoulder  pain group. The differences of the definition of injuries and pain between our studies and the previous studies which might interpret the differences. In addition,  a  previous  study  of  shoulder  pain  in Japanese  badminton  players  demonstrated  a history  of  shoulder  pain  to  be  a  risk  factor  for recurrent  shoulder  pain [21] .  In  this  study,  we found  that  badminton  players  with  a  history  of shoulder pain showed significantly higher risk of recurrent shoulder pain that consistent with the previous study.

Improper overhead motion producing abnormal kinetic chain has been demonstrated to be the mechanism  of shoulder pain and injury in previous  overhead  motion  sports  studies.  A previous studies of baseball revealed that pitchers with arm slot angle ≥ 70° at the instant of ball release showed greater shoulder external rotation that may increase the risk of  shoulder labral  injury [10] .  A  review  study  of  overhead motion sports revealed that insufficient coordination  in  shoulder  elevation  tasks  were mechanisms  of  shoulder  injuries  in  baseball pitchers, cricket bowlers, handball players, volleyball players,  football  quarterbacks  and other overhead motion sports players [22] . Another previous study of tennis demonstrated that  tennis  players  with  a  history  of  shoulder problems showed less humeral abduction which means greater arm slot angle, than those without at the end of the acceleration phase during serve [8] .  In  this  study,  our  results  were  similar  to the

previous studies that the participants with shoulder  problem  showed  significantly  greater arm slot angle.

Similar to throwing motion, badminton forehand overhead motion, referred to as a kinetic chain, requires multi-limb coordination to perform body core  mass  shift,  trunk  rotation  and  upper  limb rotation simultaneously. The complex mechanics of  the  overhead  motion  could  generate  tensile stress  on  the  shoulder [23-25] .  Undeniably,  in badminton playing, numerous  repetitions of overhead motion performing, such as clear and smash, increase the risk of shoulder problems. Health skilled badminton players showed a more constant time from peak electromyographic amplitude to hit. Immediately after hit, the electromyographic activity of flexor carpi radialis and  triceps  brachii  decreased  in  health  skillful badminton players while badminton players with immature motions showed continued electromyographic activity after hit  [5] . Deficits in kinetic chain of overhead motion causing abnormal electromyographic activity could alter stress in shoulder  joint, ultimately result in shoulder  pain  and  injury  as  a  consequence. Moreover,  the  more  arm  slot  angle  near  the instant of ball release the pitchers perform, the more elbow flexion torque occurs that the torque places  on  shoulder  joint,  which  can  lead  to superior  labrum  anterior  to  posterior  (SLAP) lesions  [10] . In addition, the offensive badminton players without shoulder problems in this study tended  towards  significantly  greater  arm  slot angle than the defensive badminton players ( p = 0.07).  We speculate that badminton players in our studies changed the phase of hit with greater arm  slot  angle,  compensating  for  deficits  in energy translation, to perform overhead stroke, which  resulted  in  abnormal  electromyographic activity in altering the tensile stress on shoulder joint. These findings support our results that type of  offensive  badminton  players  and  badminton players with greater arm slot angle showed more risk of shoulder pain and injury, and interpret why badminton players with a history of shoulder pain which  may  be  caused  by  improper  overhead motion, showed greater risk of recurrent shoulder pain.

It is not an easy task to correct overhead motion in high level badminton players who are accustomed to their greater arm slot angle and the timing at the instant of performing forehand overhead stroke. A promising badminton motor skills acquirement method, named "task analysis teaching  method" [26] ,  is  recommended  to  be implement for improper phases correction. Additionally,  balance  control  is  fundamental  to the execution of smooth and coordinated neuromuscular action that involves displacement  of  body  segments  or  the  entire body [27,28] . The execution of smooth and coordinated  neuromuscular  action  is  vital  for badminton overhead motion performance which could  be  improved  by  balance  training.  Plus, weaker  balance  ability is a risk factor for shoulder pain [11] . The advanced exercise program  and  plyometric  trainings  on  balance improved  balance  ability [29,30] ,  which  might  be implemented in badminton.

Some  limitations  should  be  considered  in  this study. Firstly, this study is a cross-sectional study. Although greater arm slot angle was speculated to be the mechanism of shoulder pain and injury, a  prospective  study  is  supposed  to  verify  the cause-and-effect.  Secondly,  2D  video  analysis has high reliability of overhead motion, however, the kinematic during forehand overhead stroke in  badminton  players  with  shoulder  problems could  not  be  studied  for  identifying  deficits  in energy  transfer.  In  future,  a  motion  capture technology, named 'Video Motion Capture System from the Part Confidence Maps of Multi-

Camera  Images  by  Spatiotemporal  Filtering Using  the  Human  Skeletal  Model  (VMocap)' which could be used in large measurement field [31] , is  supposed  to  be  used  to  detect  the mechanisms of badminton  injuries  and  pain in badminton training and matches.

## Conclusions

Offensive badminton players are more likely to suffer from shoulder injury and strong intensity of shoulder  pain.  Greater  arm  slot  angle  of  hit phase  might  be  the  mechanism  leading  to shoulder problems in badminton players.
