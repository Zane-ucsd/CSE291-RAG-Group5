## Abstract

Badminton, as a sport that demands speed, accuracy, and agility, often causes injuries to players. These injuries can reduce their quality of life and athletic careers. Therefore, effective and evidence-based injury rehabilitation is crucial for recovery and prevention of re-injury. This study aims to systematise the current evidence regarding injury rehabilitation methods in badminton and evaluate their effectiveness in supporting  player  well-being.  This  systematic  review  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  PRISMA guidelines;  this  study  screened  and  analysed  studies  from  PubMed,  Scopus,  and  Web  of  Science databases. Inclusion criteria included studies that evaluated injury rehabilitation programmes specifically for badminton players, with outcome measures of functional recovery, pain reduction, and prevention of re-injury. Quality assessment was conducted using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) tool, and data were extracted for thematic analysis. The results showed that a combination of physical therapy, strengthening exercises, and manual intervention techniques such as joint mobilisation and manipulation provided the most effective outcomes in injury rehabilitation. There is strong evidence supporting the use of  proprioceptive  training  to  prevent  re-injury.  Factors  such  as  player  age,  initial  injury  severity,  and adherence  to  the  rehabilitation  programme  were  shown  to  influence  recovery  success.  This  study concludes that the approach to injury rehabilitation in badminton should be multidisciplinary, integrating various  physiotherapy  techniques  for  optimal  outcomes.  The  findings  emphasise  the  importance  of  a tailored  and  evidence-based  rehabilitation  programme  in  supporting  athletes'  recovery  and  preventing possible  future  injuries.  This  study  also  suggests  the  need  for  further  research  to  develop  specific  and standardised rehabilitation guidelines for badminton players.

## Introduction

Badminton, recognized as one of the most popular sports in the world, demands extreme speed, accuracy,  and  endurance  from  its  players.  Although  it  presents  many  health  and  fitness  benefits,  the intensity  and  physical  requirements  of  the  sport  inherently  increase  the  risk  of  injury  for  its  athletes.

According to a study by (Marchena-Rodriguez et al., 2020), the prevalence of injuries among competitive badminton players ranged from 2.9 to 9.5 injuries per 1000 hours played, with injuries to the ankle and knee  being  the  most  common.  These  findings  highlight  the  importance  of  effective  rehabilitation strategies for recovery and future injury prevention.

Evidence-based  approaches  in  injury  rehabilitation  have  gained  widespread  recognition  in  the past decade as the best method in the management of sports injuries. This approach relies on empirical data from controlled studies to inform clinical practice, ensuring that patients receive the most effective interventions available. For example, (Thibaut et al., 2022) emphasized the importance of this approach in improving rehabilitation outcomes for shoulder injuries, proposing that clinical decisions should be based on current scientific evidence rather than on tradition or personal preference.

However, despite advances in medical research and practice, there are still gaps in the application of evidence-based approaches specific to injury rehabilitation in badminton. This is due to variations in injury  type,  severity,  and  the  individual  athletes  involved.  According  to  (Malwanage  et  al.,  2022),  the unique dynamics and movements in badminton require an in-depth understanding of injury mechanisms and rehabilitation interventions specific to this sport. This suggests the need for more focused studies to understand how best to apply evidence-based rehabilitation principles in the badminton context.

A  systematic review focused on evaluating evidence-based rehabilitation approaches in badminton could provide valuable insights into best practices. Through a comprehensive review of the existing literature, researchers can identify the most effective rehabilitation strategies while uncovering areas that require further research. A study by (Steffen et al., 2013) successfully implemented this method to evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention training programmes in team sports, demonstrating the potential of systematic reviews in informing clinical practice.

Recognising  the  importance  of  an  evidence-based  approach,  this  study  aimed  to  review  the available literature regarding injury rehabilitation in badminton systematically. The aim was to identify, evaluate, and synthesise evidence from studies that have been conducted on this topic to offer reliable recommendations  for  players,  coaches,  and  healthcare  professionals.  As  such,  this  study  not  only contributes to the body of knowledge regarding injury rehabilitation in badminton but also supports the implementation of evidence-based practices in the management of sports injuries more broadly.

## Literature Review

## A. Injuries in Badminton

Types  of  Injuries:  Injuries  in  badminton  are  common  due  to  the  high  intensity  and  repetitive movements demanded by the sport. The most common injuries include ankle sprain, knee, shoulder, and back injuries, which can vary from acute injuries like sprains to chronic injuries like tendinitis. The sport requires  a  combination  of  speed,  strength,  and  flexibility,  which  places  great  stress  on  various  muscle groups  and  joints,  especially  when  movements  are  performed  with  incorrect  technique  or  inadequate equipment (Bertrando, 2018).

An ankle sprain is one of the most commonly reported injuries, often resulting from improper landing after a jump or sudden movement to change direction. An epidemiological study by (Wang, 2023) found that these injuries are highly prevalent among badminton players, highlighting the importance of prevention through adequate warm-up and the use of proper footwear. Knee injuries, including sprained ligaments  and  meniscus  damage,  are  also  common,  as  shown  by  a  study  conducted  by  (Weber  et  al., 2020) which highlights how repetitive motion and overloading of the knee can lead to serious injuries.

In  addition,  shoulder  injuries  are  often  experienced  by  badminton  players  due  to  repetitive overhead movements, such as smashes and serves, which can lead to overuse injuries such as rotator cuff tendinitis. Studies by (Zhou et al., 2022) have identified that these repetitive movements without adequate

rest can increase the risk of shoulder injuries. Back injuries are also a concern, especially among players who perform a lot of smashes and serves, where excessive rotation and extension of the spine can lead to injury.  Research  (Dutta  &amp;  SV,  2021)  suggests  that  improper  practice  and  technique  can  cause  undue stress on the back, triggering or exacerbating injuries.

The importance of understanding and preventing injuries in badminton must be considered, given their impact on player health and performance. The identification of factors that contribute to injury is an important first step in the development of effective prevention strategies. As recommended by (Pardiwala et al., 2020), adequate warm-up, proper technique training, and appropriate equipment selection are key to reducing the risk of injury in this sport.

## B. Principles of Injury Rehabilitation

Common Approaches in Rehabilitation: A Review of Principles Injury rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of an athlete's recovery after injury, especially in intense sports such as badminton. The approach involves a series of steps designed to ensure effective and efficient recovery, reduce the risk of re-injury, and allow players to return to their peak performance. The basic principles of injury rehabilitation include rest,  ice,  compression  and  elevation  (RICE),  followed  by  physical  therapy  and  strengthening  exercises aimed at restoring function, strength and mobility of the injured area ( Sara Horvat , 2024).

Rest is the initial and perhaps most important step in the rehabilitation process. It not only refers to  the  cessation  of  the  activity  that  caused  the  injury  but  also  includes  activity  modification  to  avoid stressing  the  injured  area.  The  application  of  ice  immediately  after  the  injury  occurs  can  help  reduce inflammation  and  pain,  while  compression  and  elevation  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  swelling (Kwiecien, 2023).

After the initial  phase of recovery, physical therapy plays an important  role in injury rehabilitation.  It  involves  a  series  of  exercises  designed  to  improve  strength,  flexibility  and  stability without overloading the injured area. The physical therapy approach should be individualised, considering the type of injury and the specific needs of the player (Carreño et al., 2021).

Strengthening  exercises  are  another  important  component  of  injury  rehabilitation.  It  not  only focuses on the injured area but also on strengthening the surrounding muscles and support structures to prevent re-injury. Research has shown that a structured exercise programme can significantly reduce the risk of re-injury and improve athletic performance (Dijksma et al., 2020).

The approach to injury rehabilitation should be evidence-based, utilising available research and best  practices  to  inform  recovery  protocols.  This  ensures  that  athletes  receive  the  most  effective  and efficient treatment based on current scientific evidence. As such, collaboration between players, coaches and  healthcare  professionals  is  essential  to  designing  and  implementing  a  successful  rehabilitation programme  (King et al., 2023).

## C. Evidence-Based Approach

Concept of Evidence-Based Approach: An evidence-based approach in injury rehabilitation refers to the application of practices that are supported by the best available scientific research evidence. In the context of badminton, this is particularly important given the high incidence of injury and the need for effective recovery to enable players to return to competing at the highest level. This approach ensures that rehabilitation  interventions  are  not  just  based  on  tradition  or  custom  but  on  solid  evidence  of  their effectiveness (Thiyagarajan, 2022).

Firstly, the concept of an evidence-based approach to treatment and rehabilitation demands the use of methods that have been clinically tested and proven effective through research. This includes a comprehensive  evaluation  of  relevant  studies,  which  assess  the  effectiveness  of  various  rehabilitation techniques,  such  as  therapeutic  exercise,  physical  modalities  (e.g.,  ice  or  warm  therapy),  and  manual

interventions  (Pandey  et  al.,  2021).  As  such,  practitioners  are  expected  to  adopt  interventions  that  are most likely to produce positive outcomes based on scientific evidence.

Furthermore,  a  brief  review  of  studies  that  have  applied  evidence-based  approaches  in  injury rehabilitation suggests that the integration of knowledge from various disciplines, including physiology, biomechanics, and psychology, is crucial in designing effective rehabilitation programmes. Research by (Armento  et  al.,  2023)  found  that  rehabilitation  that  included  psychological  aspects,  in  addition  to physical interventions, was more successful in increasing confidence and reducing return-to-play anxiety in athletes after injury.

On the other hand, the use of recent technologies, such as biofeedback and virtual reality, has shown potential in improving rehabilitation outcomes through increased motivation and better monitoring of  player  progress.  The  study  (Song  &amp;  Tuo,  2022)  highlights  how  these  technologies  can  be  used  to individually  tailor  rehabilitation  programmes,  speed up  recovery,  and  potentially  reduce the risk  of  reinjury.

Finally, it is important to note that an evidence-based approach in injury rehabilitation requires continuous  updating  of  knowledge.  Practitioners  must  continuously  review  current  literature  to  ensure that  their  practice  is  in  line  with  the  latest  and  most  robust  evidence.  This  includes  participation  in continuing education and professional networks that enable the exchange of knowledge and experience (Negrini et al., 2022).

An  evidence-based  approach  in  badminton  injury  rehabilitation  offers  a  solid  framework  for developing  effective  interventions,  improving  recovery,  and  minimising  the  risk  of  future  injury.  By adopting  this  approach,  practitioners  can  provide  the  best  possible  care  for  athletes  based  on  current scientific evidence.

## Material and Methods

## A. Research Design

The research design for "Injury Rehabilitation in Badminton: An Evidence-Based Approach to Player  Wellbeing  -  A  Systematic  Review"  was  set  up  to  identify,  assess,  and  synthesise  results  from previously published studies on injury rehabilitation in badminton. This approach allowed researchers to gather evidence from multiple sources to evaluate the effectiveness of various rehabilitation methods. The researcher adopted the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework  as  a  guideline  to  ensure  that  the  researcher's  review  was  comprehensive,  transparent,  and systematic.

After study selection using the PRISMA flow chart, data from studies that fulfil the inclusion criteria will be extracted, including study design, population, interventions, and main outcomes. Quantitative analyses, such as meta-analyses, will be conducted, if data allows, to calculate the pooled effect of rehabilitation interventions. The quality of each study will be assessed to determine  the  strength  of  the  evidence.  The  results  of  this  analysis  will  be  presented  in  the  form  of  a synthesis  table  that  summarises  the  main  findings  of  the  reviewed  studies,  allowing  the  reader  to understand the effectiveness of various rehabilitation approaches in the context of badminton.

## Results

## A. Overview Studi

In this systematic review process, we identified 150 potential studies through electronic database searches and manual references. After applying strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, including relevance to  the  topic  of  injury  rehabilitation  in  badminton,  methodological  quality,  and  novelty  of  data,  we screened and selected 26 studies for further analysis. The chosen studies covered a wide range of research methodologies, including randomised clinical trials, observational studies, and case studies, conducted in different countries with participants that included badminton players from different levels of proficiency, from amateurs to professionals.

Analysis of the characteristics of the selected studies revealed that the main focus of the research was  on  knee  and  ankle  injuries,  which  is  consistent  with  the  literature  stating  that  these  are  the  most common  types  of  injuries  among  badminton  players.  In  addition,  most  of  the  studies  adopted  a rehabilitation approach involving a combination of physical therapy, strengthening exercises and activity modification as the main intervention. The range of follow-up time in these studies varied from a few weeks to one year, providing insight into the short-term to long-term effects of different rehabilitation interventions.

These  findings  provide  a  rich  basis  for  further  analyses  of  the  effectiveness  of  different rehabilitation approaches, allowing researchers to identify best practices supported by evidence in injury rehabilitation  for  badminton  players.  As  such,  the  researcher's  review  not  only  highlighted  the  most commonly studied injury types in the badminton context but also highlighted trends in the rehabilitation approaches  used,  providing  a  foundation  for  an  in-depth  discussion  of  the  relative  effectiveness  of different rehabilitation techniques.

## B. Key Findings

During the researcher's systematic review process, the researcher identified several key findings that emerged consistently among the reviewed studies. These findings provide important insights into the most effective injury rehabilitation approaches for badminton players, based on current evidence.

|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Effectiveness of Specific Rehabilitation Techniques | Traditional physical therapies, including exercises and manual therapy, are effective in injury recovery and prevention. New technologies and virtual reality show potential, although they require further validation. Inpatient rehabilitation services and robotics also offer benefits, emphasising the importance of continued research to optimise rehabilitation techniques.                   | (Peng et al., 2021)            |
| Recovery by Injury Type and Player Age              | Findings point to the need for a customised rehabilitation approach, differentiating between muscle, ligament and bone injuries and considering the age of the player. Innovations such as the Motion Control Game and ACL- specific programmes highlight the effectiveness of personalisation, including nutritional therapy and warm/cold therapy techniques, in improving rehabilitation outcomes. | (Matamala- Gomez et al., 2021) |
| Duration and Frequency of Rehabilitation Sessions   | Research highlights the importance of finding a balance in the duration and frequency of rehabilitation sessions to maximise recovery and reduce the risk of re-injury. A customised approach, considering the severity of injury and physical condition of the individual, as well as the intensity and regularity of sessions, is essential for optimal rehabilitation outcomes.                    | (Ardern et al., 2018)          |
| Holistic Rehabilitation Approach                    | Research supports a holistic approach to rehabilitation, incorporating physical, psychological, and social aspects of athlete recovery. These strategies include emotional support, stress management techniques, social support, and tailored physical interventions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional aspects in maximising well-being and successful rehabilitation.                | (Ivarsson et al., 2017)        |

In conclusion, the researcher's findings suggest that there is no single, one-size-fits-all approach to  badminton  injury  rehabilitation.  Instead,  a  successful  approach  often  requires  a  combination  of different techniques, customised to meet the individual needs of the player, with careful consideration of their injury type, age, and specific needs. This evidence-based and holistic approach is key to maximising recovery and ensuring players' long-term well-being.

## C. Evidence for an Injury Rehabilitation Approach

In  an  in-depth  exploration  of  the  effectiveness  of  different  injury  rehabilitation  approaches  in badminton,  the  researcher's  systematic  analysis  revealed  significant  evidence  in  favour  of  several  key strategies. The following is a detailed discussion based on the researcher's findings:

1. Physical Therapy: Physical therapy, including specialised exercises to improve strength, flexibility, and  balance,  shows  high  effectiveness  in  speeding  up  the  recovery  of  badminton  players. Reviewed studies have consistently found that players who undergo structured physical therapy experience a faster and more complete recovery compared to those who do not.
2. Activity Modification: The activity  modification approach, which involves adjusting the level or type of activity to accommodate the recovery phase of an injury, has also proven to be effective. Evidence suggests that this approach helps in reducing the risk of re-injury, allowing players to remain active without worsening their condition.
3. Manual Therapy: Manual therapy, including massage and joint manipulation, was found to provide benefits  in  reducing  pain  and  increasing  range  of  motion.  Although  its  effectiveness  varies between  individuals,  many  studies  report  significant  improvements  in  players  who  receive manual
4. Strengthening Exercises: An exercise programme designed to strengthen the muscles and ligaments around the injured area greatly supports recovery and prevention of re-injury. Data shows that strengthening exercises, when performed consistently and under supervision, significantly reduce recovery time and improve athletic performance after injury.
5. Rehabilitation  Start  Time:  Researchers'  analyses  found  that  starting  rehabilitation  soon  after  an injury  occurs,  taking  into  account  the  player's  medical  condition  supports  a  more  effective recovery. Evidence suggests that early intervention can reduce inflammation and pain and speed up the recovery process.
6. Durasi  Duration  and  Intensity:  Findings  emphasise  the  importance  of  tailoring  the  duration  and intensity  of  rehabilitation  programmes  to  individual  needs  and  the  severity  of  the  injury.  A programme that is too intensive or too long can be just as risky as one that is too short or not intensive, suggesting the need for a balanced approach.

## D. Practical Implications

These  findings  provide  valuable  guidance  for  health  professionals,  coaches  and  badminton players  in  implementing  effective  rehabilitation  strategies.  Choosing  an  approach  that  is  supported  by evidence can maximise recovery effectiveness, minimise time out of sport and reduce the risk of future injury. Taking this evidence into account, practitioners can design tailored rehabilitation programmes that not only support physical recovery but also improve players' psychological well-being, ensuring they can return to sport with confidence and optimal.

## Discussion

## A. Result Interpretation

The findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of evidence-based rehabilitation approaches  in  managing  badminton  injuries.  Analysis  of  the  reviewed  studies  showed  that  specific rehabilitation interventions, such as strength training, manual therapy, and dynamic stretching protocols, significantly improved recovery and reduced the risk of re-injury in players. These results support the idea

that rehabilitation that is tailored to players' individual needs and based on scientific evidence can provide better outcomes compared to standardised approaches.

Furthermore,  the  findings  confirm  that  a  multidisciplinary  approach,  involving  co-operation between coaches, physiotherapists and nutritionists, is a key factor in an effective rehabilitation process. This approach not only focuses on physical recovery but also on the psychological aspects of the player, which play an important role in motivation and confidence during the recovery phase.

In conclusion, the results of this review underline that a holistic and evidence-based rehabilitation approach is essential in maximising the well-being of badminton players, demonstrating the importance of integrating innovative and tailored rehabilitation strategies in clinical practice.

## B. Comparison with Other Studies

This  study  provides  valuable  insights  into  injury  rehabilitation  approaches  in  badminton, emphasising evidence-based principles. Compared to previous studies, this systematic review highlights the importance of integrating findings from various disciplines, including sports medicine, physiotherapy and sports psychology, to build a holistic rehabilitation strategy. For example, a study by (Feng &amp; Wang, 2023) focused on the physical aspects of rehabilitation. In contrast, the researchers' findings suggested that  psychological recovery also plays an important role in player well-being. Furthermore, a study by (Shi  &amp;  Han,  2022),  which  used  a  quantitative  approach  in  assessing  the  effectiveness  of  specific exercises, contributed to the evidence in favour of several rehabilitation techniques.

However,  the  researcher's  review  added  to  the  literature  by  highlighting  the  need  for  a  more individualised approach, acknowledging the variation in injury and recovery responses between players. The  alignments  and  differences  with  this  study  suggest  that  while  there  is  consensus  on  some  basic principles of rehabilitation, its practical application requires a broader consideration of players' specific needs and conditions. This underlines the importance of ongoing research to optimise injury rehabilitation strategies in badminton with an approach that is evidence-based and considers multidisciplinary aspects.

## C. Research Limitations

This study has several limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, most of the data reviewed came from observational and experimental studies with significant methodological variations, which may affect the consistency and generalisability of the findings. Secondly, there were limitations in the number and  quality  of  studies  that  met  the  inclusion  criteria,  particularly  with  regard  to  specific  injury rehabilitation  approaches  in  badminton.  This  limits  the  ability  of  researchers  to  conduct  in-depth comparative  analyses  between  different  types  of  rehabilitation  interventions.  Thirdly,  publication  bias may have influenced the selection of literature reviewed, with studies reporting positive outcomes being more likely to be published than studies with negative or neutral outcomes. Fourth, although efforts have been made to include studies from different geographical areas, there may still be geographical bias in the available  literature.  Finally,  the  lack  of  long-term  data  on  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the rehabilitation  interventions  tested  raises  questions  about  the  duration  of  rehabilitation  benefits.  These limitations highlight the importance of further well-designed research to address gaps in the literature and strengthen the evidence base supporting injury rehabilitation practice in badminton.

## D. Recommendations for Practice

Implementation  of  a  Structured  Warm-up  and  Cool-down  Programme:  A  thorough  warm-up before  training  or  competition  and  an  adequate  cool-down  process  afterwards  can  reduce  the  risk  of injury.  The  programme  should  include  specific  exercises  that  increase  blood  flow  to  the  muscles  and improve flexibility, especially in areas most commonly affected by injury.

Body  Awareness  and  Balance  Training:  Improving  body  awareness  and  balance  through proprioceptive exercises can strengthen players' ability to control their movements and reduce the risk of falling or moving unnaturally, which can lead to injury.

Use  of  Evidence-Based  Rehabilitation  Techniques:  Healthcare  professionals  should  adopt rehabilitation techniques that are supported by current scientific evidence. This includes manual therapy, strengthening and flexibility exercises, and the use of rehabilitation technologies such as biofeedback and laser therapy.

Player  Education:  Educating  players  on  the  importance  of  following  rehabilitation  protocols, early  recognition  of  injury  symptoms,  and  injury  prevention  strategies  is  key  to  ensuring  quick  and effective recovery and preventing re-injury.

Personalising Rehabilitation Protocols: Recognising that every athlete and injury is unique, it is crucial to tailor the rehabilitation programme to each individual's specific needs, including considering the type of injury, severity, and sporting goals of the player.

Multidisciplinary  Team  Collaboration:  Close  cooperation  between  coaches,  physiotherapists, sports psychologists and other healthcare professionals can speed up the recovery process and ensure a holistic approach to injury rehabilitation.

Adopting  this  approach  in  daily  practice  will  help  maximise  player  well-being  and  minimise downtime due to injury, allowing them to return to the field faster and in the best condition possible.

## E. Potential Future Research Directions

The findings of this systematic review pave the way for various future research directions that are important  to  develop  and  strengthen  the  evidence  base  in  badminton  injury  rehabilitation.  Firstly, longitudinal studies that evaluate the long-term effectiveness of evidence-based rehabilitation protocols are  needed.  This  will  provide  insight  into  the  durability  of  the  intervention  and  its  potential  effect  in preventing re-injury. Secondly, there is a need for more specific research on the most common injuries in badminton,  such  as  knee  and  ankle  injuries,  with  a  focus  on  customised  rehabilitation  approaches  for these injuries.

In addition, future research could also explore the integration of new technologies, such as virtual reality and wearable technologies, in rehabilitation programmes. These technologies have the potential to increase  player  engagement  in  the  rehabilitation  process  and  allow  for  better  monitoring  of  recovery. Finally, comparative studies between traditional and innovative rehabilitation approaches could provide additional evidence on the most effective methods for specific conditions. By exploring these areas, future research could make a significant contribution towards the development of more effective and efficient injury rehabilitation practices in badminton.

## Conclusions

From this systematic review, it was found that evidence-based approaches in badminton injury rehabilitation play a crucial role in accelerating the recovery process and preventing recurrent injuries. The main findings showed that specific and individualised rehabilitation protocols, which are based on current  research,  have  a  positive  impact  on  athletes'  recovery.  Methods  involving  a  combination  of physical  therapy,  muscle  strengthening,  and  psychological  recovery  techniques  proved  effective  in improving players' condition faster and minimising the risk of future injury.

The  implications  of  these  findings  point  to  the  need  for  increased  awareness  and  knowledge among  coaches  and  healthcare professionals about the benefits of evidence-based rehabilitation approaches. This includes the application of scientifically-tested protocols and adaptation to the specific needs  of  each  athlete.  Furthermore,  interdisciplinary  collaboration  is  considered  vital  to  developing comprehensive rehabilitation strategies and offering holistic support to injured players.

As such, the badminton community needs to integrate these findings into daily practice, ensuring that players get the best care backed by the latest scientific evidence. This will not only improve player well-being but also contribute to the improvement of performance and sustainability of athletes' careers in badminton.
