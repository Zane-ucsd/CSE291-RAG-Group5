## 1. INTRODUCTION:

The rotator cuff is a collection of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint and retain the head of the upper arm bone firmly in the shoulder's shallow socket. The Rotator Cuff (RC) refers to a set of four different muscles and tendons that provide strength and stability to the shoulder complex while in motion. They are also known as the SITS muscle, which stands for supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The muscles originate in the scapula and attach to the head of the humerus, producing a cuff around the glenohumeral (GH) joint. A rotator cuff injury may create a dull discomfort in the shoulder that intensifies at night. Rotator cuff strengthening exercises are often given in shoulder rehabilitation programs; however there is no consensus on the most beneficial exercise type and dosage parameters. The primary goal of shoulder rehabilitation is often to strengthen the rotator cuff and restore

## normal glenohumeral kinematics.

The goal of this study was to examine if internal and external standard rotator cuff workouts utilizing a general exercise criteria  have  been  recommended in the therapeutic environment for enhancing speed and coordination of limb movement in young badminton players.

## Strengthening exercises

The  purpose  of  strengthening  exercises  is  to  improve  the  strength  of  particular  muscles  or  muscle groups. Strengthening exercises push the muscles to their limit until they get fatigued; this force and overload of the muscles promotes muscle growth. Increasing the strength of weak muscles increases the risk of injury to the surrounding joints and soft tissues.

## Benefits of Strengthening Exercise

- Muscle strength has improved.
- Reduce energy consumption since muscles are more productive.
- Lower chance of getting hurt
- Enhance performance
- Boost the effectiveness of your movements.
- Postpone the start of arthritic diseases.

## Strengthening exercises scheduled include

- Resistance training
- Training in opposition to the water's resistance
- Using a resistance band while working out
- Weightlifting exercises
- Exercising with your own body weight as the load.

Consent  was  taken  before  performing  research.  Players  with History of previous surgeries or fracture at the elbow joint, hyper mobile joint, Use of steroid injection during  last  3  months,  Dysfunction  in  the  shoulder,  neck  and  thoracic  region,  Neurological  deficit, generalized arthritis are excluded.

## 2.2 Study design and research setting:

Study  will  be  quasi  experimental.  It  is  an  experimental  type  of  study,  based  on  pre  and  post measurements,  including  physical  activity  levels,  and  physical  health  among  badminton  player. Additionally, Exercise protocol will be conducted to explore the physical influencing of well being and identify potential interventions.

## 2.3 Instrumentation and study tool:

The tool used for the data collection of this study was a closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (ckcuest), Plate tapping test. The test was validated and reliable it in motion for the data collection. It was a multi visit study where participants had  to examine out by test containing few task about their level of fitness for game as well as day to day life,

All  participants  are  screened  for  eligibility  by  checking  if  they  fit  in  the  inclusion  criteria.  Eligible participants  were  asked  to  fill  out  the  consent  form  to  provide  consent  for  taking  part  in  this  study voluntarily. They were asked to fill out the questionnaire providing a complete  description  containing the description of the study, consent form. Data were collected by the method of convenience sampling. By the end of the study, all the responses were recorded

## 2.4 METHOD

- Plate Tapping Test
1. Purpose of the test:
- To evaluate the speed and coordination of limb movements.
2. Equipment required:
- Table (height adjustable),
- Yellow disk (20 cm diameter),
- Rectangle disk (30 x 20 cm),
- Stop watch.
3. Pre-test:

Explain the test procedure to the subject. Obtain informed consent. Complete a form and record basic information such as age, height, weight, and sex. More details about the pre-test procedure can be found here.

## 4. Procedure:

If possible, the table height should be adjusted so that the subject can stand comfortably in front of the disks. Two yellow disks are placed on the table with their centers 60 cm apart. The rectangle is placed the  same  distance  between  both  panes.  The  non-preferred  hand  is  placed  on  top  of  the  rectangle. Participants were asked to move their preferred hand back and forth across the discs over the center hand as quickly as possible, repeating this action  25 times (50 times).

## 1.1.1. Materials:

- Place strips of athletic tape (1.5 inches wide) parallel to each other (36 inches apart) on the floor.
- Yoga mate
- 1.1.2. Methods

## 1.1.2.1. Subjects

The Institutional Review Board at the A.T. Still University of Arizona Health Sciences, Mesa Campus determined this study to be safe for human subjects. Informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to data collection. The initial sample consisted of 78 male collegiate baseball players between the ages of 18 and 22 who reported no recent shoulder, elbow, or wrist injuries. Participants were recruited from two community colleges in Arizona and one NCAA Division III college in California. Participants were excluded if they did not meet the age range,  had  upper extremity surgery within the past year, did not have full clearance from their team physician to participate in training or competition, or had pain or fatigue in the upper extremity due to recent activity.

## 1.1.2.2. Data Collection Procedure

Participants completed a screening questionnaire to ensure they had no recent surgeries or injuries to the shoulder, elbow,  or wrist. Each  participant was  then  assigned an identification  number.  Each participant's  weight  was  measured  in  pounds  and  converted  to  metric  units  and  recorded.  Height  was measured  using  a  standard  10-foot  tape  measure  in  inches,  converted  to  meters  and  recorded.  Each player's position was also recorded. Each subject was then given brief instructions on how to conduct the test.  Two strips of athletic tape, 1.5 inches wide, were placed parallel to each other, 36 inches (91.4 cm) apart on a tile floor and measured with a standard tape measure. The starting position for the test was to assume  a  push-up  position  while  grasping  each  section  of  the  band  with  one  hand.  Subjects  were instructed  to  reach  across  their  body  with  one  hand  from  the  starting  position  and  touch  the  tape underneath their other hand. After touching the tape, the hand should be returned to the starting position. Subjects should perform the same movement with the other hand. A touch was counted each time a hand reached  across  the  subject's  body  and  touched  the  tape.  The  total  duration  of  the  experiment  was  15 seconds. Each subject completed a warm-up trial and then completed the actual test three times with a 45-s rest period between trials, and the average of the three runs was used for data analysis.

- The starting position for the test is in a push-up position with one hand placed over each tape.
- From the starting position, the patient is instructed to reach one hand across their body to touch the tape underneath their other hand.
- After touching the tape line, the hand is returned to the original starting position.
- The subject then performs the same movement with their other hand.
- Each time a hand reaches over the patient's body to touch the tape; it is counted as a touch.
- The total duration of a trial is 15 seconds.
- Each subject performs one warm-up trial, and then performs the actual test three times with a 45 second rest period between trials.
- The average of the three trials is used for the test result.

## Method

1. Subject assumes push-up position (male) or modified push-up position (female).
2. Subject must move hands back and forth from each line as often as possible within 15 seconds. Rows are spaced 3 feet apart.

3. Count the number of lines you touch with both hands.
4. Start with a sub-maximal warm-up. Do 3 repetitions and calculate the average.
5. Normalize the values using the following formula:
- Value = average number of lines touched / height (inches)
- Determine strength using the following formula (68% of body weight = torso, head,  arms):
- Force = 68% weight x average number of lines touched / 15
