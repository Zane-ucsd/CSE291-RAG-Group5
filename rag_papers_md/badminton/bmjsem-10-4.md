## ABSTRACT

Objectives As a high-  intensity intermittent sport with short and repeated rapid accelerations, decelerations and changes of direction, badminton involves high joint and muscle loads. This review aims to identify relevant injury risk characteristics and factors that facilitate developing and implementing badminton-  specific injury prevention programmes.

Design This systematic review of badminton injuries assessed the risk of bias, injury incidence, mechanism, location, type, severity, and risk factors.

Data sources PubMed, WoS, SURF, EBSCO, Ovid and SPORTDiscus.

Eligibility criteria Only English or German peerreviewed articles presenting epidemiological data. All age groups, genders and levels of play were represented. Results Examination of 19 studies with male (60%) and female players (41%) at different player levels (age: 10-50 years). The mean injury incidence was between 1 and 4 injuries/1000 hours, whereby the incidence in the studies that were only carried out with elite players tended to be at the upper end. Lower body injuries occurred most frequently (41%-92%), including strains (11%-64%), sprains (10%-61%), tendinopathy (6%-14%) and stress fractures (5%-11%). There was a high proportion of overuse injuries (25%-74%) and a predominance of mild and moderate injuries (73%-100%). The following risk factors can only be cautiously emphasised due to the heterogeneous results: The risk of injury increases with increasing level of play and a history of injury.

Conclusion Young players with a history of injury quickly moving to higher competition classes must be targeted with the highest injury prevention priority. Future studies should focus on improving the quality of studies by using comparable data collection methods.

## INTRODUCTION

With  a  worldwide  estimate  of  220 million fans, badminton is one of the most popular sports. 1 Aside from China and India, popularised in England, badminton is the national sport  of  various  Asian  countries. 2 With  a shuttle  cock  speed  of  up  to  565  km/hour, 3 badminton  can  be  regarded  as  the  fastest racket sport. 4 Badminton is characterised by numerous actions in which short periods of

## WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN

- ⇒ Both  acute  and  overuse  injuries  are  linked  to  repetitive movement patterns such as lunges, jumps, quick changes of direction and overhead strokes.
- ⇒ The  range  of  injury  incidence  estimates  reported in previous reviews is wide, whereby the variability between different performance levels, sex and age groups increases the uncertainty about the epidemiology in badminton.

## WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

- ⇒ The  injury  rate  ranges  between  1  and  4  injuries/1000  hours,  with  the  lower  extremities  being mostly affected, and overuse injuries appear to be a relevant problem.
- ⇒ Due to the heterogeneous results in the studies, the following risk factors can only be emphasised with caution: The risk of injury appears to increase with increasing level of play and a history of injury.
- ⇒ The included studies differed considerably in terms of  injury  definitions,  data  collection  methods  and inclusion  criteria,  which  makes  a  comprehensive conclusion difficult.

## HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY

- ⇒ With the help of knowledge about informative predictors (gender, age, training level, stress and strain parameters, etc.), injuries that occur during training and  competition  can  be  predicted  using  individualised models, allowing preventive measures to be introduced appropriately and at an early stage. This makes it possible to detect individual risk constellations for coaches and athletes.

high intensity with many accelerations, decelerations and direction changes alternate with longer periods of lower intensity during the  rally  breaks. 2  5  6 Complex  interactions between technical, tactical, physiological and psychological skills are key. 7

Although badminton is considered a non-  contact  sport,  injuries  are  remarkably common in badminton. 8 The injury frequency is between 1 and 4 injuries/1000 hours, although  some  studies  also  indicate  injury rates  of  up  to  7  injuries/1000  hours.  The

range of injury incidence estimates reported in previous reviews  is  wide,  even  within  the  elite-  player  segment. 8 The epidemiological uncertainty in badminton is further challenged by methodological heterogeneity and differences in performance levels, study quality, sex and age groups. 8

Both acute and overuse injuries are caused by typical repetitive  movement  patterns,  such  as  lunges,  jumps, quick direction changes and overhead strokes, as these movements  exert  high  stress  on  both  the  lower  and upper extremities. 8 Injuries rarely occur due to collisions with the doubles partner's racket or the double partner themselves. 8 Eye injuries occur more commonly in racket sports and have been the subject of many studies. 9 While there is a considerable body of work on injury epidemiology  in  badminton,  the  heterogeneity  and  amount  of previous work precluded a meta-  analytical work. Consequently, we opted for a narrative summary.

Adequate  injury  prevention  programming  based  on epidemiological data, addressing injury characteristics  and  risk  factors,  is  crucial  for  the  sustainable  and successful  long-  term  development  of  (elite)  athletes. Collecting epidemiological data is a crucial first part of 'prevention sequencing', described by van Mechelen et al 10 and updated and expanded by Finch 11 as the 'TRIPP framework'. This model comprises six consecutive steps: identifying the problem, analysing the causes, developing prevention  strategies,  testing  the  prevention  strategies, putting the prevention strategies into practice and evaluating  the  implementation.  The  Translating  Research into Injury  Prevention  Practice  (TRIPP)  framework particularly  emphasises  implementing  and  evaluating prevention  strategies  in  the  real  world.  Based  on  this cycle and with the aim of injury prevention in badminton, this review analyses the first two pillars of injury prevention according to Finch based on the existing literature. Therefore, sound epidemiological data on the frequency and  characteristics  of  injuries  in  badminton,  such  as mechanism,  location  and  type,  as  well  as  severity,  are important  prerequisites  for  developing,  assessing  and implementing  effective  injury  prevention  programs. 10 Against this  background, this  systematic  review  aims  to analyse and summarise available epidemiological data on badminton  injuries  to  arrive  at  comprehensive  conclusions,  including  possible  high-  risk  constellations  and valid  considerations  for  developing  injury  prevention programmes  and  the  direction  of  future  research  in injury programme implementation.

## METHODS

## Search strategy and inclusion criteria

We  conducted  the  review  according  to  the  registered protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024557604) and reported  according  to  the  Synthesis  Without  MetaAnalysis 12 in systematic reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses 13 guidance.  Meta-  analysis  was  not  appropriate because the measurement tools were too dissimilar across studies.

Two researchers (BS and HS) independently conducted  the  literature  search.  Six  medicine-  related and  sport-  related  databases  (PubMed,  Web  of  Science, SURF, EBSCO, Ovid and SPORTDiscus) were screened. The final search was completed on 16 September 2024. We  combined  the  following  search  terms  (operators) with Boolean conjunctions (OR/AND) and applied on one search level: ('badminton') AND (injur* OR epidemiolog*) AND (prevalence OR incidence).

Tracking  of  cited  articles  and  hand-  searching  relevant  primary  and  review  articles  were  also  completed. Unpublished and ongoing trials were searched via the US National Institutes of Health (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (https://trialsearch.who.int/Default.aspx). Duplicates were  removed,  and  the  remaining  studies  underwent manual screening. Three screening levels were applied: (1) title, (2) abstract and (3) full text. Irrelevant articles were  excluded.  Two  independent  researchers  (BS  and HS) made a final inclusion/exclusion  decision.  Therefore, the following inclusion criteria based on the PICOS approach  (population  (P),  intervention  (I),  comparators (C), main outcome (O) and study design (S)) were used. However, as we did not search for any intervention studies  with  a  comparison  or  control  group,  'intervention (I)' and 'comparators (C)' were omitted. No limit was set for the search with regard to the publication date to  provide  the  most  comprehensive  summary  of  injury patterns experienced in badminton.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) original research articles published as a full-  text paper in English or German in an independent peer-  reviewed journal published before September 2024, (2) observe athletes of any age of both sexes and regardless  of  their  competition  level  (recreational  to elite),  (3)  observe  any  outcome  related  to  injuries  of the  following:  incidence  (number  of  new  injuries  that occurred  to  the  population  during  a  specific  duration of time), prevalence (proportion of the population who have an injury at a specific time), mechanism, location, type, severity and risk factors.

Studies  were  excluded  if  they  (1)  were  any  type  of review  article,  case  study  or  conference  abstract,  (2) articles  dealing  with  Paralympic  sports,  (3)  studies  on the  general  epidemiology  of  sports  injuries,  including badminton, that did not present specific injury percentages for each sport and (4) items that solely addressed some  type  of  specific  badminton  injury,  for  example, articles  reporting  only  shoulder  injuries  in  badminton. We have excluded this type of study because it does not provide comprehensive figures on incidence and prevalence, only the figures for a specific type of injury.

## Assessment of methodological quality

Both  authors  independently  assessed  the  risk  of  bias (ROB) of the eligible studies using a checklist ('Risk of

Bias  Assessment  Tool'),  which  was  developed  by  Lopes et al 14 for the assessment of ROB in incidence or prevalence studies with different research designs, specifically for  the  investigation  of  musculoskeletal  injuries.  This tool  consists  of  11  criteria,  such  as  the  existence  of  an injury  definition,  a  description  of  the  population,  the follow-  up  process  or  the  data  collection  mode,  which must be answered with 'yes' or 'no' (see online supplemental material, appendix A). 14 15 An item was rated as negative if no clear item information was provided or if it was unclear whether the ROB criteria for the item were met.  Any  ROB  disagreements  between  the  two  raters (BS and HS) were resolved in a consensus meeting. The total ROB score for each trial was calculated by counting the  number  of  positively  scored  items,  expressed  as  a percentage of all items. A score of ≥ 75% was considered high quality, 75%-60% was considered moderate quality, and ≤ 60% was considered low quality (for the results of the ROB assessment, see online supplemental material, appendix B).

## Data extraction

The  data  were  extracted  by  two  authors  (HS  and  BS) using  a  structured  data  extraction  table.  These  data extraction table included information on authors, year, country,  study  design,  surveillance  period,  population (sample  size,  sex,  age,  level  of  performance,  weekly badminton training hours), injury definition, data collection method, injury incidence and prevalence (eg, injuries per athlete, injuries per 1000 hours of training exposure), injury location (eg, upper limbs), injury type (eg, sprains and fractures), injury severity (eg, days lost to injury), and injury nature (eg, acute/overuse). Due to the  heterogeneity  and  low  number  of  studies,  a  meaningful  meta-  analytical  integration  was  not  possible.  We, therefore, opted for a qualitative summary. This summary was developed based on the data extraction table as deliberate consensus within the author team.

## RESULTS

## Literature search analysis

Search results

A  total  of  998  potentially  relevant  articles  were  found (figure 1). In the first step, 337 duplicates were removed, leaving  661  articles.  Of  these,  610  were  removed  after a  title  and  abstract  screening.  This  left  51  publications whose full texts  were  analysed  for  the  previously  established  criteria.  Of  these,  30  articles  were  excluded, leaving 21 publications that could finally be included in the systematic review.

## Study characteristics

All studies were observational, with 16 included studies having  a  retrospective  design 16-31 and  the  remaining 5  having  a  prospective  design. 32-36 The  21  included studies  analysed  populations  in  11  different  countries (Denmark, 18  22  36 France, 26  31  33 Hong  Kong, 28 Iran, 19 Japan, 23  29  35 Malaysia, 24  27  32 Austria, 21 Sweden, 16 the

USA, 17  25 China 31 and  India 30 ) and  2  cross-  national studies. 20  34 One  study  compared  the  epidemiology  of badminton injuries in disabled and non-  disabled players in  Malaysia,  with  only  the  non-  disabled  players'  data included in the systematic review. 24 There are numerous differences between the studies regarding age, sex and level of play (for more details, see online supplemental material, appendix B). In addition, several studies categorised  their  data  (at  least  partially)  by  sex, 17  18  22  34-36 age, 18 20-22 26 28 29 35 level of play 36 and origin (Asian/nonAsian) 20 31 (for the individual participant characteristics, see online supplemental material, appendix B).

The  performance  level  of  the  athletes  ranged  from beginners to elite players. The players from nine studies 16-18  22  25  26  30  31  36 are  at  different  levels  of  play (recreational to elite). Only elite players are considered in five studies. 20 28 32-34 Players who are at a national level were analysed in six publications. 21 23 24 27 29 35 Zhou et al 29 investigated the injury rate of athletes of primary school age. Various standardised criteria generally allow athletes to  be  divided  into  classes  (elite,  competitive,  recreational  and  exerciser). 37 The  intention  of  the  athlete, the  training  volume  as  a  quantitative  characteristic  or the level of competition can be used for this. However, none of  the  badminton  publications  explicitly  refer  to such a categorisation. There is only a correlation to the separately specified training volume (for elite players, the indicated training amounts per week are notably higher than for recreational players).

Seven studies 16-18 21 22 25 36 were conducted before the year 2000. The average publication date was 2010 (19792022).

## ROB assessment

Only  5  of  the  21  studies  scored ≥ 75% and  were  categorised  as  high-  quality  studies. 18  23  32  35  36 16  studies scored between 60% and 75% and were categorised as moderate. 16 17 20-22 24-31 33 34 Only one study had a score ≤ 60% and  was,  therefore,  categorised  as  a  low-  quality study 19 (see online supplemental material, appendix B).

## Injury definition and data collection methods

The definition of injury and the data collection methods differed considerably between the included studies (see online  supplemental  material  appendix  C).  In  four studies,  injury  was  defined  by  admission  to  the  local hospital. 16 18 22 26 In contrast, one study considered data from all injuries entered into a database from a visit to one of approximately 100 representative US hospitals. 25 Three studies did not provide a proper definition. 17 19 28 The remaining studies considered a player injured if his performance was negatively affected by the injury during a match 17 23 27 29 32 33 36 and/or he/she required medical attention  to  continue  playing 23  24  29  30  32-35 and/or  a reduction/abstinence from subsequent training was necessary 20  23  24  29  35 and/or  affected  the  availability  for selection of a player 32 or  included any physical discomfort suffered by a player during a badminton match or

training  session,  regardless  of  the  need  for  medical treatment or time lost from badminton activities. 31 The methods  of  data  collection  also  varied  substantially:  4 studies required injury reporting by the coach or medical staff, 28  32  34  35 2  studies  instructed  players  to  self-  report injuries, 33 36 10 retrospective studies obtained data from questionnaires  completed  by  players  about  their  injury history, 17 19-21 23 24 27 29-31 1 study used data from medical records 25 and 4 studies analysed admissions to the local hospital emergency department. 16 18 22 26

## Injury incidence

Injury  incidence  mainly  ranged  between  1  and  4  injuries/1000 hours  of  exposure  time,  or  0.09  injuries/ player/year 17 and 1.09 injuries/player/year 32 (see online  supplemental  material,  appendix  C).  However, there  are  some  notable  outliers:  Marchena-  Rodriguez et al 34 reported fewer than one injury per 1000 hours of exposure (0.13 injuries/1000 hours) in senior elite players with an average age of 50.2 years. With an average incidence rate of 5.04 injuries/1000 hours, the study by Yung et  al 28 showed relatively high incidence values, whereby the rate for the oldest players ('elite senior athletes' with an average age of 24.2 years) was even higher at 7.4 injuries/1000 hours.

Kaldau et  al 20 concluded  that  48%  of  all  164  study participants (U19 players at the Badminton World Federation  (BWF)  World  Junior  Badminton  Championships 2018) suffered from at least one significant injury in their badminton career to date. Jafari et al 19 stated that 70% of the 32 athletes analysed had already suffered at least one injury in their badminton career. Nhan et al 25 found that 2.5% of all  injuries  registered  in  a  database  of  around 100 US hospitals were caused while playing badminton. In the publication by Krøner et al , 22 badminton injuries

accounted for 4.1% of all sports injuries admitted to the Danish  hospital  during  the  1-  year  observation  period. According to Fahlström et al , 16 1.2% of all sports injuries were registered in the Swedish hospital over 5 years.

Nine  studies  documented  the  number  of  injuries sustained by players in competition. 20 24 26-28 32 33 35 36 The remaining studies combined the injury data from training and competition to derive a global picture. The distribution  of  injury  rates  between  training  and  competition appeared to differ in various studies. Numerous studies reported a higher prevalence during training (training vs  competition:  65%-86.6% vs 1.7%-31%), 20 24 27 32 but also publications that presented a higher rate of injuries during the competition (training vs competition: 6.2% vs 93.8% or rather 2.8 vs 5.9-11.6 injuries/1000 hours). 26 28 33 Yung et al 28 explained that the significantly higher injury incidence during competition is due to higher physical and psychological stress.

Only one study explicitly differentiated between highlevel players (27 randomly selected Danish teams in the 1st-4th  league)  and  recreational  players  (lowest  teams from 22 of  the  27  clubs).  According  to  Jørgensen  and Winge, 36 the  proportion of overuse injuries in the incidence  of  elite  players  is  higher  than  in  recreational players, which the authors say is 'a natural consequence of  the  greater  number  of  badminton  hours  per  year'. The anatomical sites of injuries also differ: Elite players are  likelier  to  suffer  injuries  'below'  the  knee  (58%  in elite players vs 45% in recreational players). In contrast, recreational players are more frequently affected at the knee, groin and upper arm levels. The authors explained this by the higher demands on speed, mobility and power of  the  well-  trained  and  technically  better  elite  players. The  incidences  in  the  five  studies  that  only  looked  at elite  player  level  tended  to  be  at  the  upper  end  of  the incidences  (3.4-5  injuries/1000 hours  with  one  exception:  0.13  injuries/1000  hours, 34 however,  mean  age  of 50 years) in publications with players at national level or with mixed subject groups.

Comparing sex differences, no clear trends could be identified 16 : Some studies reported a slightly higher incidence rate among female players (3.5 injuries/1000 hours (female  and  elite)  vs  3.3  injuries/1000 hours  (male, elite)) 33 and 2.9 injuries/1000 hours (female and national  level)  vs  1.6  injuries/1000 hours  (male  and national level) 35 while other studies found more injuries among  men  (42%  (female,  club  level)  vs  58%  (male, club level) 18 and 46.2% (female, national level) vs 53.8% (male, national level)). 24

Some  studies explicitly emphasised the influence of  age  on  injury  occurrence.  Miyake et  al 35 reported significantly more injuries with increasing age (from the youngest male group aged 13.4±0.7 to the oldest group aged 20.0±1.2; the same applied to the female group), justified by stating that the mechanical strain of playing increases  with  increasing  skill,  which  in  turn  'grows' with  players  age.  Herbaut et  al 31 also  explicitly  emphasise that players over 26 were more prone to injury than those under-  25. According to Mohd Jamali et al , 24 a more aggressive style of play and a lack of experience mean that players under 20 sustain most injuries. This reasoning is confirmed by Saragaglia et al , 26 who investigated an age range of 10-18 years, the most injured age group in their study  and  accounts  for  37%  of  all  athletes  aged  10-66 years observed in the publication. Shariff et al 27 observed that 58.8% of all injured patients were younger than 20. According to Zhou et  al , 29 pain  and  injuries,  especially overuse  injuries,  had  an  upward  trend  with  increasing age. However, only athletes between the ages of 7 and 12 were considered in this study.

In the study by Guermont et al , 33 most injuries occurred in  January  (n=6,  17.1%)  and  August  (n=7,  20%).  The authors  explained  this  because  these  months  are  the periods after a longer break and, therefore, the returnto-  play (RTP) periods. Krøner et al 22 also confirmed the increased injury rate in phases after a longer break.

The high injury rate in the two different 'basic disciplines' (singles and doubles/mixed) was only addressed in two studies: There appear to be tendencies towards a slightly higher injury rate in singles players. 17 19 However, the localisation of the injury varied considerably.

## Mechanisms of injury

Guermont et al 33 described the smash as the stroke with the  highest  risk  of  upper  body  injury  (n=6,  46.1%). According to the authors, this is why doubles players have higher  rates  of  upper  body  injuries,  as  more  attacking strokes, such as the smash, are executed in doubles. The lunge was the footwork movement with the highest risk to  the  lower  body  (n=6,  31.6%).  Hensley  and  Paup 17 stated that the predominant cause of injury is intrinsic (eg,  during  the  movement  towards  the  ball  or  during the smash itself). Injuries caused by rackets and shuttles contact  accounted  for  only  7%  and  6%  of  all  injuries, respectively. In the study by Krøner et al , 22 8.1% of all injuries were caused by extrinsic factors such as collision with the partner or being struck by the racket or shuttle. All studies that reported at least one injury caused by direct or indirect contact with teammates or equipment 17 22 26 examined the injury rate in a high proportion of beginners  and  recreational  players.  However,  this  was  not usually defined by numbers. None of the five studies with only elite players reported contact injuries.

11 studies provided specific information on whether the injuries were acute or overuse injuries. 16 20 21 23 24 27 29 32 33 35 36 Five of these 11 studies observed that acute injuries were more common than overuse injuries. 20 23 24 29 32 The study by Fahlström et al 16 reported that 74% of all patients had no symptoms or pain at the injury site before the injury, which suggests a higher proportion of acute injuries. In contrast,  five  publications  cited  overuse  injuries  as  the more  common  cause  of  injury, 21  27  33  35  36 with  Miyake et  al 35 concluding  that  the  ratio  of  overuse  to  trauma injuries  is  three  times  higher  for  both  training  and competition.  The  frequency  of  recorded  acute  injuries ranges from 26% 36 to  73% 32 and  overuse injuries from

25% 32 to 74%. 36 In three studies, no distinction was made between acute and overuse injuries 17 19 28 and four studies only considered acute injuries that required hospitalisation. 18 22 25 26

Fahlström et  al 16 stated  that  26%  of  all  players  had either experienced symptoms at the injured site before the  injury  or  had  even  had  an  injury  at  the  same  site. Yung et al 28 observed that as many as 51% (128/253) of all  injuries  were  recurrent.  Research  by  Liu et  al 23 also demonstrated that a previous ankle injury often results in  a  recurrent  injury  at  the  same  foot  and  knee  site. However,  it  is  possible  that  the  rate  of  recurrent  injuries was even higher, as they were only recorded if they occurred during the study's observation period and not afterwards.

## Location and type of injury

All studies provided information on the anatomical distribution of the injuries that occurred and presented the percentage distribution across the upper and lower body and other body parts (see online supplemental material, appendix D). Only one study did not list any figures; it only  named  the  lower  extremities  the  most  affected. 18 In all 21 included studies, the largest percentage of injuries was observed for the lower extremities. This ranged from 92.3% in Fahlström et  al 16 to  41% in Nhan et  al . 25 In  12  studies,  the  upper  extremities  were  the  second most frequently injured body region. 17 19 21-24 26 27 30 31 33 36 In  contrast,  the  results  of  five  studies  showed  that  the second  most  frequently  injured  area  was  the  back  or trunk. 20 25 29 32 35

Høy et  al 18 found  only  3  cases  of  eye  injuries  among 2060  club  players,  all  requiring  no  further  treatment. Therefore, they do not recommend wearing protective eyewear during the game. Jørgensen and Winge 36 found only 2 eye injury cases out of 229 reported injuries. In the study by Krøner et al , 22 2.3% of all injuries involved the  eyes.  Hensley  and  Paup 17 reported  7%  of  eye  injuries.  81% of all cases were caused by the shuttle hit by the opponent, not by a racket hit by themselves or their doubles partner.

Krøner et  al 22 found no difference with regard to the anatomical side of the injuries. In the study by Guermont et  al , 33 all  injuries  to  the  upper  extremities  occurred exclusively on the dominant side.

13 of the 19 studies provided information on the type of  injury  sustained  during  the  respective  observation period  (see  online  supplemental  fmaterial,  appendix D). 16-18  20  22  24-26  30  32-34  36 Of  these,  eight  studies  cited strains  or  sprains  as  the  most  common  acute  injury type. 18 20 24-26 30 32 36 These ranged from 12% 36 to 64%. 28 32 Muscle injuries in general, 22 26 33 34 rupture of the Achilles tendon, 16 18 36 fractures, 20 25 26 36 tendon and ligament injuries 22 34 and skin injuries 17 25 33 were also cited as common types of injury. Tendinopathies 20 32 and stress fractures 20 32 were the most frequently reported overuse injuries. Four publications did not specify the exact type of injury, only the localisation of the injury, 21 27-29 and three studies did not provide a more precise injury diagnosis. 19 23 35

## Severity of injury and RTP

Nine  studies provided  information  on  the  injuries' severity (see online supplemental material, appendix D). Two of these categorised injury severity using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), 16 18 which grades injuries from one (minor) to six (maximum, untreatable). Six studies categorised injury severity by elapsed time to RTP, 27 31-35 using different periods such as &lt;1 day, 1-3 days, 4-7 days, 8-28 days  and  &gt;28  days  to  classify  injury  severity.  Two studies  reported  the  percentage  of  injuries  that  were severe  enough  to  require  medical  attention  and  treatment. 17 22 Except for the studies by Jørgensen and Winge 36 (mean injury time: 48.4 days) and Kaldau et al 20 (median injury time: 90 days), all studies that consider the time to RTP reported a greater proportion of lost time less than 28 days. The studies that use the AIS scale for categorisation also described most injuries (73%-100%) as minor or moderate rather than severe.

## SUMMARY AND POTENTIAL FOR INJURY PREVENTION

The injury incidence was mainly between 1 and 4 injuries/1000 hours.  Some  studies  with  higher  and  lower rates  exist.  Our  results  are  comparable  with  the  injury rate results of other racket sports, such as tennis, where injury  incidences  range  between  0.04  and  3.0  injuries/1000 hours were found. 38 The dominance of lower body  injuries  compared  with  upper  body  injuries  is similar to other racket sports. Most upper body injuries in  tennis  tend  to  be  overuse  injuries,  while  injuries  of the lower body are more likely to be caused by trauma. 38 As there seems to be no clear consensus on the distinction between acute and overuse injuries in badminton, a direct comparison with other sports remains challenging. Different  injury  frequencies  have  been  identified  in tennis, although neither of the two types of injury (acute/ overuse) appears to dominate. 38

If we compare the injury rates in badminton with those of other non-  contact individual sports such as gymnastics, we find comparable injury rates of 1-4 injuries/1000 hours with  few  outliers. 39 For  professional  golfers,  an  injury rate  of  three  injuries  per  player  was  found  retrospectively  over  an  observation  period  of  two  golf  seasons. 40 For the amateur golfer, two injuries per player have been observed. 40 A total of 637 injuries were identified in 703 players. However, this study did not indicate that injury incidence was adjusted per 1000 hours of play. In repetitive endurance sports, such as long-  distance running, the incidence was between 2.5 and 5.8 injuries/1000 hours, with 50%-75% being overuse injuries due to the constant repetition of the same movement. 41

The second of the six pillars of prevention research, according  to  Finch, 11 entails  the  identification  of  the injury mechanism and possible risk factors, the complex interaction of which is responsible for sports injuries. Due to  the  heterogeneous findings in the studies described

here,  the  following  risk  factors  can  only  be  cautiously emphasised: The risk of injury appears to increase as the level  of  play  rises,  and  a  history  of  injury  also  appears to be associated with an increased risk of reinjury. This finding is based on the results of Jørgensen and Winge, 36 who  explicitly  found  a  higher  proportion  of  overuse injuries in elite players, as well as the fact that the injury rates in the five studies that only examined the level of elite players were generally at the upper end of the incidence rates. Three publications 16 23 28 specifically show an increased injury rate after an injury to either the same site or a different body site related to the original injury.

Furthermore,  the  lower  extremities  are  particularly affected,  and  overuse  injuries  appear  to  be  a  relevant problem. Coaches and medical staff should be aware of these risk factors and pay particular attention to young professional  athletes  with  a  history  of  injury.  Especially during  athletic  development,  young  players  move  to high-  competition  classes  and  promptly  increase  their training  workload.  The  association  between  the  occurrence of injuries and training load has been observed in numerous studies. 42 It  is,  therefore,  often  important  to ensure that the total load of young players is adapted to their training history to counteract the problem of too much progress being desired in too short a time without the  body  being  prepared  for  the  increased  demands. This means that adapting to the progression of intensity, duration  and  frequency  of  training  to  the  individual's performance and fatigue level is of crucial importance. 43

This  point  is  underlined  by  the  high  proportion of  overuse  injuries,  which  require  a  systematic  injury prevention programme that considers mobilisation, strength training and other aspects of the treatment and prevention  of  overuse  injuries. 42  44 It,  therefore,  seems useful for coaches to record the acute training load to get an idea of whether the training volume, frequency or intensity needs to be reduced. On the one hand, excessive  and  rapid  increases  in  training  loads  account  for many injuries. 45 Piggott and Newton 46 showed that 40% of injuries were associated with a rapid change (&gt;10%) in  the  weekly  training  load  in  the  preceding  week.  On the other hand, evidence suggests that appropriate physical training benefits by developing physical qualities that protect against injury. 45 It has been shown that a greater amount of short, high-  intensity acceleration training and game-  specific  aerobic  activities  can  equip  athletes  with the appropriate physical qualities to perform at a high level and protect against injury. 45

Another  approach  to  monitoring  the  load  would  be regularly completing a questionnaire, such as the 'Short Recovery and Stress Scale'. 47 48 This instrument assesses the emotional, physiological, mental and overall aspects of recovery and stress. 48 This is also important in the offtraining lives of young people with a lot of potential stress in their private lives and at school. Although the degree of physical maturity is not explicitly addressed in any of these studies, particular attention should be paid to this due to the 'injury age' of under 20 years emphasised in some studies. Adolescence is a time of physical, psychosocial  and  cognitive  development  and  physical  and psychological  instability  in  which  hormonal,  musculoskeletal  and  neurocognitive  changes  of  adolescence drive factors for sports-  related injuries. 49 Changes in the muscle skeleton and subsequent physiological characteristics affect the increased risk of sports-  related injuries. 49 Training  methods  adapted  to  the  development  stage could help reduce injuries and growth-  related overload conditions. 50 Repetitive  mechanical  loads  that  require rapid  deceleration  and  a  quick  change  of  direction should be reduced in favour of more technically oriented movement exercises. 51

Injury history is also a major risk factor for future (re) injury  to  the  body  region  in  question. 52 53 This  may  be due to residual deficits in the previously injured joint or muscle, such as proprioceptive deficits, altered muscular recruitment  patterns  or  altered  biomechanics, 54 which make the athlete more susceptible to reinjury. 53 There is a strong positive correlation between the exposure time and the total number of injuries. 55 This results in a direct relation  between  an  athlete's  past  career  time  and  an existing injury history. For this reason, an injury history often affects older players, for whom a balanced and individualised training plan is very important.

## LIMITATIONS

A meta-  analysis was not conducted in our systematic review due  to  significant  differences  in  methodologies,  populations  and  interventions  among  the  included  studies.  This heterogeneity  made  it  challenging  to  combine  the  results quantitatively in a meaningful way. As a related issue, insufficient studies were identified to perform a statistically robust meta-  analysis.

This paper combines the two types of systematic review, the 'Systematic Review of Incidence 56 57 ' and the 'Systematic Review of Aetiology'. 57 58 The heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of study design, indication of incidence and indication  of  risk  factors  did  not  allow  for  the  distinction between  those  two  perspectives.  We,  therefore,  could  not consider the two methodological approaches and the needs of  the  two  principles  separately.  Still,  we  had  to  combine them to obtain a well-  rounded overall picture.

A  comparison  of  injury  rates  between  different  studies within  badminton  and  between  different  sports  is  thus limited  and  would  be  facilitated  by  the  consensual  use  of proper  injury  definitions  and  the  standardisation  of  incidence reporting. The BWF published a consensus statement on injury definitions and data collection methods to standardise future injury surveys in 2022. 59 This resulted in the definition  of  injury  developed  by  the  World  Federation: 'Any physical  injury  sustained  by  a  player  during  a  match or training regardless if further diagnostic tests were done or if  playing  time was lost', 59 which can be used in future studies. Depending on the injury definition and data collection  method  used,  studies  tend  to  underestimate  the  real injury rate: Underestimation may occur, for example, when only injuries requiring medical treatment are recorded or

when studies are conducted with self-  reporting past injuries (recall bias and social desirability). This may also apply to the lower outlier who reported less than one injury/1000  hours. In this case, the injury definition was that an injury was only counted as such if it  was  reported  to  medical  staff  by  the player  concerned  or  if  medical  assistance  was  required. 34 In contrast, other studies may have overestimated injuries, particularly those in which players reported all types of pain and discomfort that may be due to a training effect rather than an actual injury. Yung et  al 28 stated a high incidence, although they did not define the term 'injury' directly. This makes  it  impossible  to  understand  the  range  of  injuries recorded,  as  the  definition  was  interpreted  very  broadly. As  described  above,  a  standardised  definition  would  be important for the future.

The quality of the studies in the checklist adapted from Lopes et  al 14 averaged 71% and is, therefore, of moderate quality. Because most publications were retrospective studies, there was a risk of a notable recall bias. In addition, some studies did not provide any information on the distribution of risk between training and competition and/or on changes over  the  year,  which  also  led  to  a  deduction  of  points  in the quality assessment. As many studies did not record the hours of training and competition, there was also a lack of standardised information on injury incidence as injuries per 1000  hours of exposure, which means that the study results are not comparable between all studies. This highlights the impact that injury definitions and data collection methods can have on injury outcomes and emphasises the need to introduce consistent guidelines for future epidemiological studies in badminton to make the results more meaningful. In addition, many of the results of this work are based on only a few studies, which at the same time only have a small number of cases. It is, therefore, important to interpret the results with this background knowledge.

Data on specific risk factors should be considered when developing injury prevention programmes. In badminton, however, scientific information on risk factors is limited. In particular, methodologically sound prospective longitudinal studies are lacking. Only 5 of the 19 studies included here were  prospective,  while  the  others  collected  retrospective data. These five prospective studies had an average quality of 80% and were, therefore, of high quality with a low ROB.

## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

The mean injury rate in all studies was between 1 and 4 injuries per 1000  hours of exposure, and the incidences tended to be at the upper end in the studies conducted with elite players only. Lower body injuries occurred most frequently, including  strains,  sprains,  tendinopathies  and  stress  fractures, with a high proportion of overuse injuries. All studies considering the time to RTP reported a greater proportion of less than 28 days of lost time. The studies that used the AIS scale  for  categorisation  also  described  the  majority  of all injuries as minor or moderate rather than severe. Due to the heterogeneous findings in the studies presented here, the risk factors described (high level of play, injury history, pronounced susceptibility of the lower extremities and many overuse injuries) can only be emphasised with caution.

The  studies  included  in  this  review  differ  substantially regarding  injury  definitions  and  data  collection  methods. More  research  should  be  carried  out  in  the  field  of  risk factors to obtain more information on the epidemiology of badminton and avoid injuries more frequently in the future. Better data (large, multicentre prospective cohort studies) methodologically based on published consensus statements are  needed  to  stabilise  the  tentative  findings.  In  addition, studies in which injury rates are recorded strictly according to  different  characteristics  (eg,  gender,  level  and  training frequency) are particularly useful. This further development of the epidemiological report would also help injury monitoring and injury prevention in elite sports since 'Top shape and injuries are close neighbours'. 60
