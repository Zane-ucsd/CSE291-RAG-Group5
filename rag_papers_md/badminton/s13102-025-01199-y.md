## Abstract

Research background Despite the abundance of common physical training programs designed for healthy badminton players, there is a significant gap in comprehensive studies evaluating their impact on player performance.

Research purpose This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effects of common physical training programs on performance outcomes of healthy badminton players.

Method To address this gap, a meticulous search was conducted across several databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost, up until January 2024, leading to the selection of relevant articles for a systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis using Review Manager (version 6) software.

Result The review incorporated 370 participants from 15 studies, with 12 studies qualifying for the meta-analysis. These studies commonly implemented exercise interventions ranging from 4 to 10 weeks, with participants undergoing 2 to 3 sessions weekly. The meta-analysis results showed that VO2max data indicated significantly improved performance in the experimental group (EG) (SMDb = 1.27; P =  0.0001;   I 2 =  0.0%) with low heterogeneity. Agility data also demonstrated significantly improved performance in the EG (SMDb = -0.61; P =  0.01;   I 2 =  13%) with low heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis of balance performance revealed significant improvements with different physical training programs: balance related training (effect size 5.63, p &lt;  0.001,   I 2 =  35%), pilates training (effect size 2.25, p &lt;  0.001, I 2 =  78%), and core training (effect size 6.82, p &lt;  0.001,   I 2 =  33%).

Conclusion This review found that high-intensity interval training and sprint interval training both improve VO2max in badminton players. High-intensity interval training, core training, strength and resistance training, and Pilates all enhance agility. Core training and lower limb resistance training help improve power. Balance training, core training, Pilates, and balance enhancement exercises contribute to better balance. Additionally, balance training improves the reactive strength index, while core training enhances smash performance. The meta-analysis indicates that current studies are more effective than traditional exercises in improving VO2max, agility, and balance. Nonetheless, further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to more accurately identify effective training interventions for improving performance in healthy badminton players.

## Introduction

More  than  2000  years  ago,  games  resembling  badminton were played in ancient European and Asian civilizations [1]. In recent years, badminton ranks as one of the most  popular  racket  sports  in  Malaysia  and  countries such as China, Indonesia, Korea, and Denmark [2]. Badminton is widely recognized as one of the most popular sports worldwide, with an estimated 220 million people regularly  playing,  ranging  from  professionals  to  leisure players. It is commonly reported to be the second most popular  sport  after  football,  though  such  rankings  may vary depending on the source [3, 4].

Recognized  as  the  fastest  racket  sport  in  the  world, badminton involves repeated movements including accelerations,  decelerations,  jumps,  leaps,  lunges,  and rapid changes of direction [5]. Consequently, it demands a  variety  of  skilled  postural  variations  and  movements from players [6]. Research has shown that, among all athletic  abilities,  technical  skills  in  playing  badminton  are paramount. Coaches also play a crucial role in addressing athletes'needs to achieve high performance levels [7, 8].  Furthermore,  technology  in  badminton  sports  has become  a  significant  focus  of  research,  with  particular attention to both equipment and performance analysis.

Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in  research  in  the  field  of  badminton,  enhancing  the knowledge of  badminton  players  in  areas  such  as  technique, tactics, timing, body biomechanics, and psychology [9, 10]. To reach an elite level, players must possess high-level  skills  [11,  12].  Achieving  notable  success  in international badminton competitions also requires athletes to focus on improving their physical fitness alongside  their  technical  training  [13].  Despite  this,  there  is a  paucity  of  comprehensive  studies  that  systematically compare  the  effectiveness  of  various  training  programs on badminton performance [14, 15]. This gap highlights the necessity for a systematic review to consolidate existing evidence and clarify the impacts of different training methodologies.

It  has  been  found  that  a  player's  speed  in  hitting  the shuttlecock  often  correlates  with  their  success  in  the game [16].  Achieving  this  speed  requires  not  only  general  physical  fitness  but  also  specific  attributes  such  as exceptional  agility  to  navigate  the  court  swiftly,  significant strength to deliver powerful smashes, and sustained endurance to maintain high performance levels throughout intense matches [17, 18]. To enhance this aspect of performance, specialized training for athletes is essential [19].Badminton training should adhere to scientific principles, with appropriate training loads, gradual increases in  physical  intensity,  and  the  use  of  diverse  techniques and equipment for strength training to achieve optimal results  [20].  The  common  physical  training  programs used  by  badminton  players  include  plyometric  training  [21-25],  core  training  [19,  26-28],  interval  training [29, 30], resistance training [31, 32], Pilates training [33], and routine exercise  [6,  19,  21,  26-31,  33],  among  others. These methods are crucial in badminton due to the sport's demands for agility, speed, power, and endurance [34-40].  A  comprehensive  training  program  develops these attributes, essential for high-level competition and peak performance. Previous research is often limited by small  sample  sizes  and  inconsistent  training  protocols, which impede the ability to draw definitive conclusions [29, 41, 42].

In  addition,  opinions  are  divided  on  whether  different  training  programs  significantly  enhance  badminton players'performance [14, 43]. A meta-analysis allows for the aggregation of data from multiple studies, increasing statistical  power and providing more accurate estimates of  training  program effects  [44].  This  approach  resolves inconsistencies in previous research and identifies overarching trends, facilitating the development of optimized training  strategies  for  badminton  players  [45,  46].  This study focuses on two primary goals:

- 1)  To incorporate up-to-date data on these training programs, detailing the features of the selected research.
- 2)  To  acknowledge  the  limitations  and  prospects  of existing  research  and  suggest  directions  for  future studies of practical significance.

## Methodology

In  this  review,  the  research  team  adhered  to  the  recommendations  given  in  the  update  of  the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews  and  MetaAnalysis  (PRISMA)  statement  [47].  This  protocol  was registered  at  the  International  Prospective  Register  of Systematic Reviews (INPLASY) with registration number INPLASY2023120034.  We  confirm  that  the  record  has been published on inplasy.com.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

This review includes English literature published on Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost prior to January 2024. Studies that meet the criteria  outlined  in the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS) framework will be considered for analysis [48].

## Inclusion criteria

- 1)  Population: Healthy badminton players (regardless of sex, age, badminton experience or level of play).
- 2)  Intervention: The training experiment for more than 4 weeks.

- 3)  Comparison: The study compares the training group(s)  with  a  control  group  or  another  training intervention group.
- 4)  Outcome:  Record  evaluations  of  physical  or  physiological performance areas.
- 5)  Study designs: RCT study design.

## Exclusion criteria

- 1)  Non-English printed articles.

- 3)  Cannot be retrieved in full text.
- 4)  Review, meta-analysis, conference paper, book, book chapter, generic.
- 5)  The articles do not simultaneously meet the PICOS inclusion criteria.

## Search strategy and selection process

The  four  electronic  databases  that  this  research  system  searched  for  articles  on  this  subject  were  Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science,  and  EBSCO  host.  These  four databases  are  commonly  used  in  the  field  of  sports  science  research.  Boolean  search  strategies  were  employed using'AND'and'OR'operators.  Use  the  following  search terms for a Boolean search: ("training"OR"exercise* "OR"intervention"OR"physical training"OR"exercise training"OR"resistance training"OR"strength training"OR"aerobic exercise*"OR"power training"OR"fitness training"OR"endurance training"OR"conditioning training"OR"physical therapy"OR"plyometric training"OR"interval training"OR"circuit training"OR"functional training"OR"core training"OR"high-intensity interval training"OR"HIIT"OR"mobility training"OR"balance training"OR"flexibility training"OR"speed training"OR"speed endurance training"OR"explosive training"OR"anaerobic training"OR"sports-specific training"OR"specificity training"OR"skill-based training"OR"movement training"OR"motor skills training"OR"reaction time training"OR"sport conditioning"OR"powerlifting"OR" weight training"OR"bodyweight training"OR"isometric training"OR"dynamic training"OR"metabolic conditioning"OR"cross training"OR"strength and conditioning") AND  ("badminton athletes"OR"badminton players"OR"badminton beginners"OR"shuttler") AND ("performance"OR"athletic performance"OR"sport performance"OR"physical performance"OR"training effects"OR"performance improvement"OR"performance enhancement"OR"physical fitness"OR"strength"OR"flex ibility"OR"agility"OR"speed"OR"power"OR"endurance"

OR"coordination"OR"balance"OR"technical skills"OR"t echnique"OR"technical performance"OR"skill"OR"skill development"OR"skill performance"). In addition, a manual search of references and Google Scholar was done to make sure  no  relevant  articles  were  missed.  To  guarantee accuracy and completeness, knowledgeable librarians assisted with the data collection process in the interim.

## Study selection

Figure  1  illustrates  the  specific  procedures  for  selecting studies. Initially, redundant articles were eliminated. The second step involved evaluating the titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text screening to assess preset eligibility requirements. This process was completed by two impartial  reviewers  (MSZ  and  XYQ),  with  any  disagreements being  thoroughly  investigated.  A  third  reviewer  (KGS) was involved as needed until consensus was reached. To address potential inconsistencies in evaluations between reviewers, we implemented a calibration exercise prior to the screening process. Both primary reviewers independently assessed a subset of studies to ensure consistency in applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows that 718 papers were identified through database searches,  and  2  additional  studies  were  found  through other references. 38 studies were included in the full text assessed for eligibility. However, 22 articles were excluded because  they  did  not  simultaneously  meet  the  PICOS inclusion criteria, and 2 were excluded because they did not  report  numerical  results.  No  studies  were  excluded due to inability to retrieve full texts, as all relevant articles were accessible. After full text assessed for eligibility, 15 papers met all the inclusion criteria for the systematic review.  However,  only  12  articles  were  included  in  the meta-analysis, while the remaining 3 were excluded from the meta-analysis because they did not include three or more outcome indicators [22, 23, 32].

## Data extraction and synthesis

The inclusion criteria determined which data to extract: 1) Author and year of publication; 2) Sample size; 3) Participant  characteristics  (e.g.,  sex,  age,  and  level  of  exercise); 4) Intervention characteristics (type, frequency, and duration);  and  5)  Study  outcomes.  We  summarized  the means  and  standard  deviations  (SD)  from  the  included studies. If a publication did not specify the mean and SD for  the  intervention  outcomes,  we  extracted  additional data and converted it using recognized methods [49-51]. Specifically,  when  estimating  the  post-intervention  SD, we used the following formula, where SD post represents the  post-intervention  standard  deviation,  SD  pre  represents the pre-intervention standard deviation, and R is a constant, usually taken as 0.5:

If  pertinent  information  was  missing  from  the  articles and there was no response from the corresponding author upon contact, we excluded the study.

## Risk of bias and the certainty of evidence assessment

The Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment was carried out using the Cochrane RoB instrument [52]. This tool assesses the risk  of  bias  across  seven  domains:  incomplete  outcome data,  selective  reporting,  allocation  concealment,  blinding  of  participants  and  personnel,  blinding  of  outcome assessment,  random  sequence  generation,  and  other sources  of  bias  [53].  Each  domain  can  be  categorized as'low, ''unclear, 'or'high. 'Two assessors conducted each procedure, and a third assessor was consulted in cases of disagreement  between  the  first  two.  The  findings  demonstrated  unclear  risks  in  allocation  concealment  and blinding of participants and personnel, as well as in the bias of outcome evaluation, but showed a low risk of bias for selective reporting and random sequence generation across the studies.

## Statistical analysis

In the outcome, if there are not three or more study variable  indicators  included,  they  will  only  be  included  in the systematic review and not in the meta-analysis. This threshold  ensures  sufficient  data  for  robust  statistical pooling  and  focuses  on  variables  related  to  the  physical and skill performance of badminton players, thereby enhancing the reliability and validity of the meta-analysis results  [54].  We  conducted  a  meta-analysis  on  three  or more study indicators using RevMan (version 6; available at https://  revman.  cochr  ane.  org).To reflect the effect size, we used the mean and standard deviation of the performance indicators  before  and  after  the  intervention.  We then  standardized  the  data  using  the  post-intervention performance  indicators. The meta-analysis  employed both  random-effects  and  fixed-effects  models  to  facilitate analysis while accounting for heterogeneity between studies. The   I 2 statistic was used to assess the impact of heterogeneity,  with  values  &lt; 25%,  25-75%,  and  &gt; 75% indicating low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively  [55].  When  high  heterogeneity  is  detected    (I 2 &gt; 50%), a random-effects model is used to account for the variability  among  studies.  In  cases  of  low  heterogeneity (I 2 ≤ 50%), a fixed-effects model is applied, assuming that

the studies estimate the same underlying effect. For outcome indicators with different units, standardized mean differences (SMD) are calculated to facilitate comparison across studies. When outcome indicators have the same units, mean differences (MD) are used for analysis. Additionally,  the  RoB  assessment  was  carried  out  using  the Cochrane RoB instrument to examine the risk of publication bias [56, 57].

## Results

## Risk of bias and the certainty of evidence assessment

The categorization of bias risk was based on RoB tool [58]. Studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias when  they  provided  clear  and  adequate  methods  to minimize bias in each domain. An unclear risk of bias was  assigned  when  there  was  insufficient  information to  determine  the  risk  level,  often  due  to  inadequate reporting. A high risk of bias was identified when there were evident flaws in the study design or execution that could introduce significant bias. In this graph (Fig. 2), each  row  represents  a  study,  and  each  column  represents  a  type  of  bias.  The  color  indicates  the  assessed likelihood  of  each  bias  type  within  each  study:  green for a low risk of bias, yellow for an unclear risk of bias, and  red  for  a  high  RoB.  In  these  reviews,  the  risks  of allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), and blinding  of  outcome  assessment  (detection  bias)  are  not clearly  low  or  high.  Other  biases  also  present  unclear risks.  However,  there  are  low  risks  identified  in  selective  reporting  (reporting  bias)  and  random  sequence generation  (selection  bias).  Incomplete  outcome  data (attrition bias) is noted to have a minimal low risk.

## Participant characteristics

Table 1 provides details on the characteristics and functional  training  programs  of  370  participants  from  15 studies that met the inclusion criteria:

- 1)  Gender Classification: Of the studies, seven focused on male athletes [6, 19, 22-24, 26, 33], one on female athletes  [21],  four  included  both  male  and  female athletes  [25,  27,  29,  32],  and  three  studies  did  not provide detailed descriptions [28, 30, 31].
- 2)  Sample Size: The total number of individuals across the 15 studies was 370, with each study involving 16 to  40  participants.  Four  studies  had  different  numbers of participants in experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) [6, 21, 26, 28], while the rest had equal numbers in both groups.
- 3)  Nationality: The studies encompassed participants of various nationalities, including five with Chinese [22, 24,  29,  31,  32],  two  with  Turkish  [27,  28],  two  with Indian participants [25, 33]. Additionally, there were studies with participants from Australia [6], Malaysia [30], Canada [21], Egypt [25], the United States [23], and Iran [26].
- 4)  Badminton  Training  Background:  Thirteen  studies provided  details  on  the  participants'years  of  training, with two exceptions [26, 28]. Six studies required participants to have more than five years of experience [19, 22-24, 29, 30]

## Intervention characteristics

The included 15 studies were categorized based on three intervention  characteristics:  intervention  length,  intervention frequency, and intervention type.

- 1)  Intervention  Length:  One  study  implemented  an intervention for 4 weeks [32], two studies for 5 weeks [25, 33], six studies for 6 weeks [21-24, 27, 31], five studies for 8 weeks [6, 19, 26, 28, 29], one studies for 10 weeks [30].
- 2)  Intervention Frequency: Nine studies employed a three-times-per-week  frequency  [6,  21-24,  26, 28-30]; three studies had a two-times-per-week frequency [19, 27, 33]; and three did not specify the frequency [25, 31, 32].
- 3)  Intervention  Type:  In  the  EG,  five  studies  utilized plyometric  training  [21-25];  four  studies  engaged in  core  training  (including  Swiss  Ball  Training)  [19, 26-28]; two studies conducted interval training [29, 30];  two  studies  applied  resistance  training  [31,  32]; one  study  opted  for  Pilates  training  [33]  and  one study opted for Balance training [6]. For the CG, ten

studies  followed  routine  exercise  [6,  19,  21,  25-31, 33]; Three studies matched with plyometric training [22-24]; one study applied velocity-based resistance training [32] and Regularly scheduled training [27].

## Outcome

## VO2 max

The  effect  of  training  on  badminton  players'aerobic  fitness has been examined in two studies [29, 30]. Suppiah tested  sixteen  male  badminton  players  aged  thirteen  to fifteen.  The  EG  underwent  high-intensity  interval  functional  training,  while  the  control  CG  received  regular training  for  10  weeks.  The  results  indicated  significant differences  in  fitness  levels  between  EG  and  CG  at  distances  greater  than  20  m.  VO2  max  increased  significantly after 10 weeks of high-intensity interval training, as indicated by F(1,14) = 4.663, ( p &lt; 0.05) [30]. Liu's study involved  32  top  badminton  players,  with  the  CG  participating in regular multi-ball training sessions and two Fartlek runs over 8 weeks. In contrast, the EG engaged in Sprint Interval Training three times per week. The anaerobic threshold VO2 max in the EG significantly increased from  75  ± 4%  to  82  ± 4%  ( p &lt;  0.05),  which  was  significantly higher than that in the CG. Similarly, in the male CG, it increased from 74 ± 10% to 85 ± 3% ( p &lt; 0.05) [29].

## Agility

The effects of various training regimens on the agility of badminton players have been examined in six studies [24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33]. Among them, five studies in the CG group  employed  conventional  training,  while  one  study used plyometric training. In Suppiah's study involving 16 male badminton players aged 13 to 15, significant differences in four-corner agility tests were observed between EG and CG (F(1,14) = 5.443, p &lt; 0.05), indicating that agility significantly improved after 10 weeks of high-intensity interval  training  [30].  Another  study  tested  28  athletes [28], where the EG underwent core training three times a week for 8 weeks, leading to observed improvements in agility as measured by the Illinois agility test. In the study [27],  badminton  players  were  randomly  divided  into  a EG and CG. Despite EG undergoing Combined Strength Training twice a week for 6 weeks, the Illinois agility test showed  no  significant  changes  ( p &gt;  0.05).  The  sample size of this study was 40, with the EG group undergoing Strengthening  and  plyometric  resistance  training,  while the CG group performed Routine exercise. The intervention lasted for 5 weeks, but the Frequency was not specified. The Outcomes indicated that the EG group showed improvements  in  Vertical  jump  and  plank  test  [25].  In Preeti  et  al. 's  study  [33],  40  male  athletes  were  divided into two groups: EG (group A), which performed Pilates training  alongside  routine  training,  and  CG  (group  B),

which  only  performed  routine  training.  After  5  weeks, agility  test  results  between  EG  and  CG  showed  significant differences ( p &lt;  0.05). However, in Guo et al. 's study [24],  16  elite  male  badminton  players  were  divided  into a  balance  and  enhancement  training  group  ( n = 8)  and an  enhancement  training  group  ( n = 8).  After  6  weeks, the  SEMO agility test showed no significant differences between  the  balance  and  enhancement  training  group and the enhancement training group.

## Power

Two  studies  have  explored  the  effects  of  various  training programs on the explosive power of badminton players  [28,  31].  In  the  study  of  Dinç  et  al.  [28],  28  athletes were evaluated, with the EG participating in core training three times per week for a total of 88 weeks during the  intervention  period,  while  the  CG  did  not  engage in  this  additional  training.  The  explosive  power  was assessed using the standing long jump, which showed a significant difference between the EG and CG ( p &lt;  0.05) [28].  In  a  separate  study,  24  active  badminton  players were randomly assigned to either a CG or a EG [31]. The EG underwent lower limb resistance training with elastic  bands,  which  not  only  increased  resistance  but  also enhanced lower limb strength,  while  the  CG  continued with  their  standard  training  regimen.  The  EG  outperformed the CG in measures of explosive power, as evidenced by superior results in the standing long jump and vertical jump height tests [31].

## Balance

Eight  studies  have  investigated  the  effects  of  various training regimens on the balance performance of badminton players [6,  19,  21,  22,  24,  27,  28,  33],  with  six incorporating strength-based interventions. These studies  collectively  indicate  that  the  EG  often  outperforms  the  CG  in  improving  balance  performance among badminton  players.  In  the  study  by  Guo  et  al. [24],  16  elite  male  badminton  players  were  randomly assigned  to  either  a  balance  training  group  ( n = 8)  or an enhancement training group ( n = 8). After a 6-week intervention, results from the Y-Balance test suggested a superior interaction effect in the BP group compared to the PL group [24]. In Alikhani's study [21], 22 healthy female badminton novices were randomly divided into a CG and an EG. The EG underwent 6 weeks of physical  therapy,  with  dynamic balance evaluated using the Y-balance test. Post-therapy, the EG showed significant improvement in dynamic balance ( p = 0.003) [21]. Malwanage et al. [6] involved 20 male badminton players, with the intervention group ( n = 12)  receiving  30  min of  balance  training  in  addition  to  regular  badminton training  twice  a  week  for  eight  weeks,  while  the  CG

( n = 8)  only  received  regular  training.  Assessments  of dynamic balance (using the star excursion balance test) and  static  balance  (using  the  single-leg  stance  test) were made both at baseline and after 8 weeks. Improvements  in  balance  were  observed  in  both  groups,  with significant enhancement in dynamic balance noted only in the intervention group ( p = 0.036) [6]. Solanki et al. [19]  divided  20  badminton  players  under  19  years  of age into a core training group ( n = 10)  and  a  CG  ( n = 10), finding that the training group exhibited improvements  in  motor  balance  after  an  8-week  intervention [19]. In the study by Preeti et al. [33], 40 male athletes were  randomly  divided  into  an  EG  (Group  A),  which performed Pilates training in addition to routine training,  and  a  CG  (Group  B),  which  adhered  only  to  routine training. The star excursion balance test was used to  assess  dynamic  balance,  revealing  significant  differences between the EG and CG ( p &lt; 0.05) [33].

In their study, Lu et al. randomly assigned 16 elite male badminton  players  to  either  a  balance  enhancement training group ( n = 8) or a regular enhancement training group ( n = 8) [22]. Over six weeks, the balance enhancement  training  group  underwent  balance  enhancement training three times weekly, whereas the regular enhancement  training  group  participated  in  their  enhancement training sessions only once weekly. The motion stability of the athletes before and after the intervention was evaluated using the dynamic postural stability index and the center of pressure metrics. The results demonstrated that the balance enhancement training group showed significant improvements in motion stability compared to the regular enhancement training group. Specifically, for the forward dynamic postural stability index (F-DPSI), lateral dynamic postural stability index (L-DPSI), forward center of pressure in anteroposterior (F-COPAP), forward center of  pressure  in  mediolateral  (F-COPML), forward composite center of pressure path length (F-COPPL), and lateral center of pressure path length (L-COPPL), the balance  enhancement  training  group  exhibited  significant improvements ( p = 0.003, 0.025, 0.024, 0.002, 0.029, and 0.043,  respectively).  However,  there  were  no  significant differences  between  the  balance  enhancement  training group and the regular enhancement training group in the changes  observed  for  lateral  dynamic  postural  stability index (L-DPSI), lateral center of pressure in anteroposterior (L-COPAP), and lateral center of pressure in mediolateral (L-COPML) ( p &gt; 0.907) [22]. In the study by Dinç et  al.,  [28]  28  athletes  were  evaluated.  During the intervention period, the EG participated in core training three times a week for 8 weeks, whereas the CG did not engage in core training. The assessment of balance through the double right/left foot balance test revealed no significant difference between the EG and CG [28].

## Reactive strength index

Two studies have investigated the impact of varied training programs on the reactive strength index in badminton  players  [24,  32].  In  the  research  conducted  by  Guo et  al.,  [26]  16  elite  male  badminton  players  were  randomly divided into two groups: the enhancement training group  ( n = 8)  and  the  balance  and  enhancement  training  group  ( n = 8).  After  a  6-week  intervention  period, the  balance  and  enhancement  training  group  showed  a superior interaction effect on the reactive strength index test  compared  to  the  enhancement  training  group  [24]. On the other hand, a different study randomly assigned 18  badminton players into two groups: the Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise group and the Variable Resistance Training group [32]. Following 4 weeks of resistance training combined with their seasonal training routine,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  reactive strength index changes observed between the two groups ( p &lt; 0.05) [32].

## Smash

Only one study has examined the impact of training on badminton  smash  performance.  Hassan  et  al.  investigated the effect of core training on the technical performance of badminton players. In this study, 20 badminton players under the age of 19 were divided into two groups: a  core  training  group  ( n = 10)  and  a  control  group  ( n = 10).  The  forehand  smash  performance  of  these  two groups was tested after 8 weeks of training. The results showed significant differences in smash speed and accuracy  between  the  two  groups  ( p &lt;  0.05)  [59].  The  study concluded  that  8  weeks  of  core  stability  training  could enhance  the  smash  performance  of  young  badminton players.

## Meta-analysis

that  were  covered  in  more  than  three  studies,  such  as the  effects  on  maximal  oxygen  uptake,  agility,  and  balance  performance.  Other  outcomes,  requiring  further aggregation, were excluded from the meta-analysis due to insufficient data.

## VO2 max

Two studies contributed VO2 max data. Liu et al. examined the effects of high-intensity functional interval training on the study group [29], while Suppiah investigated the impact of sprint interval training on their participants [30].  In  both  studies,  the  CG  underwent  routine  exercise. Each study included three EG and three CG, totaling  thirty-two  participants  across  the  two  studies.  The interventions of  sprint  interval  training  and  high-intensity functional interval training were visually represented on a forest  plot.  Analysis  revealed  that  there  was  a  significant difference in VO2 max performance between the badminton players in the EG and those in the CG (SMDb = 1.27;   Chi 2 = 1.78; p &lt; 0.001;   I 2 = 0.0%; Fig. 3).

## Agility

Agility  data  were  extracted  from  five  studies.  Dass  [25] applied  both  strengthening  and  plyometric  resistance training,  whereas  Dinç  et  al.  focused  on  core  training [28]. Preeti et al. utilized core training [27]. The EG underwent high-intensity functional  interval  training  in the study [30], while the CG engaged in routine or conventional  training.  The  forest  plot  analysis  reveals  no significant  difference  in  the  agility  performance  among badminton players subjected to strengthening and plyometric resistance training, core training, Pilates instruction, and high-intensity functional interval training, compared  to  routine  exercise  (SMDb = -1.45;    Chi 2 = 84.44; p = 0.06;   I 2 = 94%; Fig. 4). This suggests a high level of heterogeneity across the studies.

The  CG,  which  underwent  routine  training  interventions  (regular  training,  normal  training),  and  the  EG, which  received  additional  training  interventions,  were both included in a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis serves to summarize and integrate the findings from multiple studies. Therefore, we restricted the meta-analysis to metrics

This  study  systematically  analyzed  the  impact  of  each individual article on the overall heterogeneity in an effort to pinpoint its source. It was observed that removing one or two studies did not effectively reduce the heterogeneity. Subsequently, it was revealed that the primary source of heterogeneity stemmed from the studies conducted by

Fig. 4 Agility performance in comparison to the control group

Preeti et al. [30, 33] and Dass [25], even after the exclusion of three studies. Upon further investigation, it was found  that  agility  performance  among  badminton  players was influenced differently by strengthening and plyometric  resistance  training  compared  to  routine  exercise (SMDb = -0.61;   Chi 2 = 2.29; p = 0.01;   I 2 = 13%; Fig. 5).

## Balance

Data on balance performance were collected from seven studies [6, 19, 21, 26-28, 33]. This study conducted a subgroup analysis based on training methods to investigate the effectiveness of core training (core strength training), pilates  training,  and  balance-related  training  (combined balance  and  plyometric  training,  Swiss  ball  training) compared  to  routine  exercise  on  badminton  balance performance. The subgroup analysis results were significant   (Chi 2 = 8.98, p &lt;  0.001; Fig. 6). We found that Core Training,  Pilates  Training,  and  Balance-related  Training all achieved significant effects on athletes'balance performance compared to routine exercise  ( p &lt;  0.001).  Under the random-effects model, the intervention effects of Balance-related Training and Core Training were significant, with  effect  sizes  of  5.63  (95%  CI  [2.36,  8.90], p &lt;  0.001) and 6.82 (95% CI [4.08, 9.56], p &lt; 0.001), respectively. The heterogeneity  was  moderate,  with    I 2 = 35  for  Balancerelated Training and   I 2 = 33 for Core Training. However, for the effects of Pilates Training, although a significant difference was observed, there was noted high heterogeneity    (Tau 2 = 0.14,    I 2 = 78%),  with  an  effect  size  of  2.25 (95% CI [1.82, 2.67], p &lt; 0.001).

## Discussion

This  review  investigates  the  effects  of  training,  such  as plyometric resistance training, core training, Pilates instruction, and high-intensity functional interval training, on the physical fitness and badminton-specific skills  of  players.  The  results  reveal  significant  positive effects of these exercises on various measured variables, encompassing VO2 max, agility, power, balance, reactive strength index, and smash. This study will focus on analyzing the impact of training on these six variables.

## VO2 max

Badminton is an intermittent sport characterized by prolonged  periods  of  high-intensity  exercise  interspersed with rest intervals [60]. Despite the intermittent nature of the activity, subjects exhibit elevated oxygen uptake and heart rate responses, comparable to maximal laboratory tests [60]. Previous research has highlighted a strong correlation  between  physiological  parameters  and  badminton  performance  [61,  62].  Specifically,  aerobic  capacity shows a positive  association  with  interval  performance,

including  parameters  like  VO2  max,  lactate/anaerobic threshold,  and  running  efficiency  [63,  64].  Also,  there was  a  close  relationship  between  VO2  max  scaled  and the density of capillary vessels, and there were also more numbers of capillaries in skeletal muscles if they were of high activity [65]. Therefore, sufficient VO2 max is essential  for  optimal  athlete  performance  [66].  Traditional methods such as long slow distance and fartlek are commonly employed by badminton coaches to enhance aerobic fitness [67].

Recent  studies  have  demonstrated  that  high-intensity functional  interval  training  and  sprint  interval  training  significantly  improve  badminton  players'VO2  max compared to regular exercise [29, 68]. The combination of  high-intensity  interval  training  with  functional  exercises  has  garnered  international  recognition  [69,  70]. Functional training refers to specialized training tailored to  athletes'specific  performance  improvement  goals  in their  respective  sports  [67,  71].  Sprint  interval  training is recommended as an alternative to traditional continuous  aerobic  training.  It  involves  brief,  maximal  effort actions  with  active  rest  periods  and  minimal  recovery time between training sets [29]. Athletes with low overall training volume during intervals can benefit from sprint interval training, as active rest periods between multiple short,  high-intensity  sprint  sessions  typically  last  only 3-5 minutes [72]. As a result, these two types of training can enhance badminton players'performance in interval exercises while significantly reducing training volume.

## Agility

In  badminton,  quick  movements  and  rapid  changes in  direction  necessitate  brief  bursts  of  energy.  Therefore, agility plays a crucial role in the success of players [73-75].  Effective  agility  performance  relies  on  various factors and inputs, encompassing physical (strength and conditioning),  cognitive  (motor  learning),  and  technical (biomechanics) components [76]. While the training methods employed by the EG in most studies showed a significant impact on badminton agility tests, meta-analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences. The substantial  heterogeneity  observed  across  the  five  studies  in  the  meta-analysis  is  likely  attributed  to  variations in measurement methods used to quantify agility in each

study. Quantifying agility has proven challenging due to the sport-specific demands of different activities, including  controlling  the  badminton  shuttlecock  or  swinging the racket [74].

Agility  tests  often  involve  intricate  movements,  making it unclear what exactly is being measured, and a high score may conceal deficiencies in other aspects of agility [74]. According to Sheppard &amp; Young, there remains no consensus among sports scientists regarding the definition of agility [76]. Traditionally, agility has been defined as  speed  in  changing  direction  [77,  78].  However,  more recent perspectives suggest that agility requires perceptual  skills  in  addition  to  the  ability  to  change  direction quickly, making it a complex interplay of various fitnessrelated factors [76, 79]. Young et al. affirmed that agility is a closed motor skill that can be planned and executed in a stable environment, challenging the previously held notion of its flexibility [80]. Nonetheless, agility involves rapid whole-body movements triggered by specific stimuli, as noted by Sheppard and Young [76].

Various  agility  tests,  including  the  burpee  test  (squat thrust), side step test, shuttle run, quadrant jump, SEMO agility test, right boomerang run, Illinois agility run, and 505  agility  test,  are  utilized  [74,  81].  Some  researchers argue that  each  sport  necessitates  unique  measurement tools to assess agility [77, 82-85]. However, for badminton,  there  is  currently  no  authoritative  or  standardized agility measurement method [86].

## Power

Badminton players are required to process a significant amount of information rapidly, with little time between learning and action [87]. It appears that explosive power training may offer a solution to enhancing reaction time [88,  89].  As  far  as  we  know,  data  on  the  performance enhancement mechanisms of power athletes at the muscle cell level is unavailable. However, power training can selectively hypertrophy fast-twitch muscle fibers, potentially maximizing growth adaptations before they gradually  thin  out  [90,  91].  When  Ooi  et  al.  investigated  the physiological  characteristics  of  elite  and  sub-elite  badminton players, they discovered significant differences in power between the two groups [92].

The results of lower-limb resistance exercise and core training, as observed in the two studies reviewed, exhibited superior effects compared to routine exercise. Given the  paramount  importance  of  power  fitness  in  athletes,  which  directly  impacts  efficiency,  it  is  logical  that both  studies  employed  jump  tests  to  assess  badminton players'power quality. The dynamic nature of badminton, characterized  by  rapid  direction  changes,  leaps,  lunges at  the  net,  swift  arm  movements,  and  various  short, explosive  motions,  underscores  the  relevance  of  such tests [93].

Moreover, research indicates that athletes participating in functional training programs perform better on vertical countermovement jump tests [94, 95]. However, there is  currently  limited  research  available  on  methods  to enhance badminton players'jumping ability, necessitating further investigation to validate this hypothesis.

## Balance

Balance  is  the  process  of  keeping  the  body's  center  of gravity  vertically  aligned  over  the  base  of  support.  It depends  on  rapid,  continuous  feedback  from  visual, vestibular,  and  somatosensory  systems,  followed  by  the execution  of  smooth  and  coordinated  neuromuscular actions  [96].  In  badminton,  rapid  changes  in  direction, leaps, forward lunges, quick arm movements, and various postural adjustments are all essential [93]. Therefore, proficient balance is crucial for badminton players to execute swift  postural  transitions  on  the  court  effectively  [97]. Reviewing  the  literature  reveals  a  predominant  focus on  how  badminton  players'balance  is  influenced.  Our research substantiates the efficacy of Swiss ball training, core  stability  training,  combined  balance  and  plyometric training, balance training, and core strength training. When compared to routine exercises, these interventions enhance badminton players'balance.

Previous  studies  have  demonstrated  that  fatigue  in trunk  muscles  leads  to  diminished  dynamic  stability and loss of balance control [98-101]. Swiss ball training, core stability training, combined balance and plyometric training, balance training, and core strength training contribute to improving dynamic balance and muscle coordination between the lower and upper limbs. Additionally, they help reduce the risk of injury and muscle imbalance, thereby enhancing athletes'balance [27]. The crucial role of core muscles in balance serves as a logical explanation for this phenomenon. The core comprises the diaphragm as the roof, pelvic floor and hip girdle musculature as the bottom, erector spinae and gluteal muscles as the back, and the abdominals as the front [102]. During lower and upper extremity exercises such as running, throwing, and jumping, the core muscles stabilize the spine and trunk, leading to improved balance among badminton players.

## Reactive strength index

According to previous research, among all physical abilities,  the  most  reliable  predictor  of  badminton  excellence is change of direction performance (r = 0.74) [103]. Therefore, optimizing this capacity is crucial for enhancing on-court performance among badminton players. To date,  several  change  of  direction  ability  tests,  including the Hexagon test, 5-0-5 test, and Modified SEMO test,

have  been  extensively  utilized  for  badminton  assessment [27, 104, 105], proving to be reliable indicators of players'on-court performance [24].

Young assessed the ability of muscles to transition from eccentric to concentric contractions during jumping and developed  the  Reactivity  Intensity  Index  [106].  Reactive strength refers to an individual's ability to effectively utilize  the  stretch-shortening  cycle,  characterized  by the capacity of the musculotendinous unit to generate a rapid  and  powerful  concentric  contraction  immediately after a quick eccentric action [107]. The reactive strength index  is  calculated  by  dividing  jump  height  by  contact time during a drop jump [108]. In the study conducted by Guo et al. [24], participants underwent tests to assess their  change  of  direction  ability,  including  the  5-0-5 test, Southeast Missouri test, Y-Balance test, and reactive strength index, before and after the training session. Following the intervention, significant time × group interactions  were  observed  for  the  5-0-5  change  of  direction test,  Y-Balance  test  for  both  legs,  and  reactive  strength index,  as  indicated  by  repeated-measures  ANOVA  ( p &lt; 0.05,  partial  η^2 = 0.26-0.58)  [24].  Conversely,  another study utilizing reactive  strength  index  measurement showed the opposite effect [32].

Based on previous research, enhancing reactive strength index can be achieved by increasing jump height and reducing contact time. Meta-analysis conducted by Rebelo  et  al.  [109].  Revealed  that  both  long-term  [110] and  short-term  [111,  112]  resistance  training  elevate reactive strength index in teenagers, although its impact is less pronounced among experienced adult athletes.

## Smash

Smash strokes often determine the outcome of a game, and  they  are  likely  the  most  frequently  utilized  strokes among  younger  players.  The  effectiveness  of  a  smash stroke  primarily  hinges  on  accuracy  and  smash  velocity  [59].  Only  one  study  has  shown  that  core  strength training enhances spiking ability. The badminton smash ranks among the most powerful techniques in all racket sports [113]. Speeding up and controlling the rhythm of the game are essential for gradually reducing the reliance on high balls. Accelerating the match's pace and bolstering the offensive play enhance the game's enjoyment and contribute  to  winning  strategies  [114,  115].  To  create subsequent  offensive  opportunities,  it  is  crucial  to  execute  accurate  and  strategic  kills,  directly  scoring  points [115, 116]. The speed at which badminton players strike the  shuttlecock  often  correlates  with  their  success  [61]. Implementing  strength  training  is  therefore  essential to  enhance their  striking  speed  [117].  Targeted  training programs significantly improve muscular power, allowing players  to  execute  more  forceful  and  faster  shuttlecock strikes [16]. This increase in strength directly contributes to  enhanced  smash  performance  [118].  Consequently, integrating  power-focused  exercises  into  training  regimens  is  crucial  for  optimizing  smash  effectiveness  and overall  game  performance.  Therefore,  additional  evidence regarding the impact of various training methods on badminton players'smash abilities is warranted.

## Limitations

This systematic review, which  adhered  to  PRISMA reporting guidelines. It ensures an unbiased evaluation of quality and offers pertinent data regarding the efficacy of different training methods. However, there are a number of limitations to this study, chief among them being the following five points.

- 1)  Finding trustworthy measuring instruments is essential  because  the  wide  variation  in  the  instruments used to evaluate each performance compromises the comparability of study results.
- 2)  Certain studies don't provide a thorough explanation of the training program, and they omit some crucial details that could compromise the description's accuracy.
- 3)  This  meta-analysis  includes  studies  with  small  sample sizes, which may lead to less robust conclusions and potential biases. Most studies in this review used small sample sizes (8-20 participants per experimental group), and only two studies disclosed how their sample sizes were calculated [26, 33].
- 4)  Owing  to  the  significant  variations  in  intervention techniques  across  various  studies,  this  analysis  only included the majority of routine exercise (traditional training, normal training, conventional training) intervention  studies  for  the  study's  CG.  There  was insufficient evidence for analysis in the CG of other kinds  of  intervention  studies  according  to  a  metaanalysis [22-24].
- 5)  This  systematic  review  includes  several  multi-arm studies,  which  may  result  in  statistical  dependency issues.  Future  research  should  consider  using  multilevel or multivariate meta-analysis methods  to address this problem and provide more accurate and unbiased effect size estimates.

## Conclusion

Our review has found that high-intensity interval training and sprint interval training can improve VO2 max in badminton players. Additionally, high-intensity interval training, core training, strength and resistance training,  and  Pilates  can  enhance  agility.  Core  training  and  lower  limb  resistance  training  can  improve power,  while  balance  training,  core  training,  Pilates,

and  balance  enhancement  training  can  improve  balance.  Furthermore,  balance  enhancement  training  can improve the reactive strength index, and core training can  enhance  smash  performance  in  badminton  players.  Overall,  these  findings  highlight  the  importance of  incorporating  diverse  training  methods  to  optimize various  physical  performance  metrics  in  badminton players. The meta-analysis showed that current studies are more effective than routine exercises in improving VO2  max,  agility,  and  balance  in  badminton  players. However,  further  high-quality  methodological  studies are needed to customize specific training programs for healthy badminton players. Coaches should tailor training  programs  based  on  skill  levels,  while  considering frequency and intensity for optimal results. To address the identified gaps, future studies should focus on more standardized  research  designs,  such  as  randomized controlled  trials,  to  evaluate  the  long-term  effects  of these  training  methods  on  performance  and  injury prevention.
