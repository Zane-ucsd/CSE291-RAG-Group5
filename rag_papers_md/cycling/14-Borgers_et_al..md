Overuse injuries of the knee are a common cause of missed training and competition days in elite cyclists, however the underlying conditions causing this knee pain are not well defined. We conducted a diagnostic study,  investigating  a  consecutive  series  of  53  high level cyclists with non-traumatic knee pain over a 14 month period. Demographic data on the participants' cycling specialty and training level was noted. Clinical information concerning knee pain intensity, location and occurrence were collected using a questionnaire. Our  results  show  7  different  overuse  injuries  were identified. The prepatellar friction syndrome accounted for the majority of these overuse injuries (46%),  while  medial  plica  syndrome  (15%),  biceps femoris  tendinopathy  (7.5%),  patellar  tendinopathy (9.4%), infrapatellar plica friction syndrome (7.5%), infrapatellar fat pad impingement (5.7%) and iliotibial  band  syndrome  (3.7%)  were  other  causes of knee pain in these athletes. In contrast to current belief, our results show that instead of patellofemoral cartilage  overload,  friction  related  overuse  injuries are  the  most  frequent  and  underestimated  cause  of knee pain in high level cyclists.

## INTRODUCTION

Competitive  cycling  is  a  very  demanding  sport with cyclists training and racing for multiple hours at  high  velocity  and  intensity (12) .  Due  to  the repetitive  nature  of  the  pedalling  activity  with  up to 80 - 100 revolutions per minute, overuse injuries are quite  common (2) . Many epidemiological studies  concerning  the  high  incidence  of  overuse injuries in elite and recreational cyclists  have found  that  knee  overuse  injuries  are  the  most prevalent (3,4,39,40) .  One  study  which  focused  on 65  professional  road  cyclists,  found  that  overuse accounted  for  62%  of  the  injuries (4) .  A  recent survey of 109 professional cyclists found that the most  common  injury  in  professional  cyclists  was lower  back  pain  (46%),  followed  by  knee  pain (23%) (11) .  Although  knee  pain  was  less  frequent than low back pain, it accounted for 57% of injury related time loss (11) . De Bernardo et al. found that 32%  of  overuse  injuries  were  located  around  the

knee in a cohort of 51 active professional cyclists (6) .  This  result  corresponds  with  a  study  of  the National Team athletes of the British cycling squad where knee injuries were the second most common injury (18%) and the main cause of total days lost for training/competition (32) . Recent review articles mainly focus on factors associated with knee pain in  cyclists  without  using  a  differential  diagnosis (7,25) .  Despite  the  epidemiological  evidence,  little is  known  about  the  underlying  clinical  entities leading to knee pain in high level cyclists. Since the introduction of the term 'cyclists' knee' (31,34) , knee pain  in  cyclists  has  been  assimilated  to  'anterior knee  pain',  'chondromalacia'  or  'patellofemoral pain  syndrome'.  Many  studies  focused  on  knee pain in cyclists often state that patellofemoral pain syndrome  is  the  underlying  cause,  without  any proof of evidence (1,16) .

In  our  experience  treating  high-level  cyclists, the above-mentioned  knee  conditions  are only rarely  seen  in  these  athletes.  In  this  study  we report  the  results  of  53  cyclists'  knees,  outlining a  comprehensive  differential  diagnosis  of  typical overuse  injuries.  This  study  describes  the  clinical features, physical examination and diagnostic imaging  modalities  of  the  most  frequent  clinical entities in our practice.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

We conducted a single centre prospective diagnostic study. Between October 2015 and December 2016 all cyclists visiting our outpatient sports  clinic  with  knee  pain  exclusively  related to  cycling  activities,  were  included.  All  patients were evaluated by the two senior authors (TC and SC).  Knee  pain  during  cycling  was  the  primary inclusion criterium. Chronic overuse injuries originating from minor trauma were included while all acute traumatic knee injuries, such as fractures or ligamentous injury, were excluded. All patients gave their informed consent before participating in the study.

Demographic data, the average number of hours  of  training  per  week,  the  average  number of  miles  per  year,  their  cycling  discipline  (road cycling,  cyclo-cross,  mountain  bike  racing  or  a combination)  and  their  training/competition  level (recreational, amateur competition, UCI U23, UCI Continental,  UCI  Pro-continental  and  UCI  World Tour) were noted. Data about duration of the injury, prior  trauma,  medical  history  of  the  complaint and a specific cycling related knee pain questions were collected. A thorough work-up was conducted in each case, consisting of medical imaging (ultrasound,  MRI  and  radiography)  as  necessary according  to  the  suspected  underlying  pathology and a medical examination. Treatments were noted and return to competition (if applicable) at the last follow up was recorded.

## RESULTS

Over the course of 14 months, 48 cyclists with 53  painful  knees  were  included.  Our  population consisted of 45 male and 3 female cyclists. Three patients  were  included  more  than  once,  as  they presented with either a new injury in the previously treated  knee  (n  =  3)  and/or  a  new  injury  to  the contralateral knee (n=2). The age of the participants ranged  between  13-61  years,  with  an  average  of 29 years. Our series consisted of 15 high mileage recreational  and  33  competitive  cyclists  (Table  I).

Table I. - Training level and distribution of patients

| Training level      |   Number of patients |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Recreational        |                   15 |
| Amateur competition |                    7 |
| UCI U23             |                   12 |
| UCI Continental     |                    6 |
| UCI Pro-continental |                    6 |
| UCI Worldtour       |                    2 |

Different cycling disciplines were included; 35 road cyclists,  2  cyclo-cross  cyclists,  2  mountain  bikers and 7 cyclists who combined  different disciplines.

The average annual training distance of the cohort was 17149 ± 9729 km. Professional cyclists (UCI U23, Continental, Pro-Continental and World Tour) in  our  series  rode  22536  ±  8284  km  on  average and non-professional cyclists rode on average 9111 ±  5226  km.  The  average  weekly  training  time  of

amateur cyclists was 8.2 ± 3.9 hours and 16.2 ± 5.1 hours for professional cyclists.

Median  duration  of  knee  pain  was  6  months. A  wide  range  in  the  duration  of  the  injury  was observed, ranging from 1 week to almost 10 years. The injury duration mostly depended on the level of the rider, the severity and onset of the complaints and the success of previous treatments. Professional cyclists tend to consult faster than non-professional cyclists (median duration of 2.8 months versus 21 months respectively).

Eleven  clinical  entities  were  found  to  be  the cause of cycling induced pain around the knee in our patient cohort.

Four  cases  (8%)  were  classified  as  'miscellaneous' as  they  consisted  of  an  osteochondritis  dissecans lesion of the medial femur condyle, a symptomatic mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament,  a  medial  meniscus  tear  and  a  vastus medialis muscle impingement.

Seven  specific  clinical  entities  were  identified encompassing the remaining 44 patients and will be outlined by their location (anterior, medial or lateral side).

## Anterior knee pain

Prepatellar friction syndrome

The  prepatellar  friction  syndrome  (PPFS)  is  an extra-articular cause of anterior knee pain (10) . In this syndrome,  repetitive  microtrauma  due  to  overuse or  a  direct  (minor)  traumatic  impact  can  damage the  normal  triple-layer  organization  of  the  fascia overlying the patella (17) . The impairment of normal gliding of the fascial layers leads to abnormal friction with  repeated  flexion  of  the  knee  during  cycling. Focal defects in the intermediate layer or thickening and  neovascularity  of  the  prepatellar  fascia  can be  found  intraoperatively  (Fig.1).  The  prominent superomedial  or  superolateral  ridges  of  the  patella are  particularly  at  risk.  PPFS  was  found  to  be  the most prevalent cause (46%) of knee pain diagnosed in this patient cohort.

A typical case usually presents with anterior knee pain during cycling. The pain starts during or after a long training, training camp or multiday competition. A crash or minor trauma to the patella, like hitting

<!-- image -->

the stem or handlebar, can initiate PPFS. Fifty-two percent  of  the  patients  diagnosed  with  prepatellar friction syndrome recalled a preceding trauma to the knee.

Cycling  at  a  high  cadence  or  wearing  tight  leg warmers  may  aggravate  the  pain.  Lowering  the cadence or cycling 'en danseuse' may alleviate the pain. This  can  be  explained  either  by  reducing  the friction  of  the  soft  tissues  over  the  patella  or  by  a decrease of the maximal knee flexion angle which also reduces  the  pressure.  Of  note,  these  characteristics are  the  opposite  of  what  is  typically  reported  in  a suspected patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Clinical examination can reveal a defect or irregularities  in  the  prepatellar  fascial  layers  by superficial  palpation.  Pain  can  be  elicited  by  local pressure over the pathological spot; this may be the superolateral, superomedial or inferomedial ridge of the patella.

Ultrasound (Fig.2) and MRI (Fig.3) are able to demonstrate the presence of PPFS. These imaging techniques  typically  show  a  disturbance  in  the triple layer structure of the prepatellar fascia, more specifically a defect, thickening of the fascia or fluid between the layers.

In this cohort 15 patients underwent an MRI and in  11  cases  the  diagnosis  was  confirmed  (73%). 22  of  23  PPFS  patients  were  investigated  with ultrasound. Ultrasound demonstrated  prepatellar fascial thickening, fascial defect and thickening in 64% of cases. In 4 patients medical imaging could not confirm the clinical diagnosis.

Acute  presentations  of  PPFS  can  be  managed conservatively  with  a  period  of  rest  or  low-dose steroid. Chronic symptoms and posttraumatic PPFS are often treated with surgery. Of the patients with PPFS in our study cohort, 91% underwent surgery. All competitive cyclists were able to return to racing at the last follow up.

## Infrapatellar plica friction syndrome

The  'infrapatellar  plica  friction  syndrome'  or IPPFS is a relatively rare cause of chronic refractory anterior  knee  pain  in  the  high  mileage  cyclist  in our series. The pain is caused by the accumulated friction  of  the  infrapatellar  plica  or  'ligamentum mucosum'  over  the  intercondylar  cartilage  during flexion-extension of the knee.

Patients typically present with anterior knee pain that emerges after some hours of cycling. The pain increases with higher cadence, but quickly subsides when  cycling  activity  is  ceased,  and  is  localized slightly inferior or deep to the patella.

Infrapatellar  plica  friction  syndrome  was  the cause  of  anterior  knee  pain  in  4  patients  of  our study cohort (7.5%). Of these, 3 patients underwent anarthroscopic resection of the ligamentum mucosum, leading to complete symptom relief for all 3 patients. A 4 th patient healed after local steroid injection in combination with six weeks of rest.

Clinical  examination  is  atypical,  with  a  tender anteromedial and -lateral Hoffa as the most frequent finding.

MRI  imaging  of  the  knee  is  able  to  visualize the existence of an infrapatellar plica, but does not allow  distinction  between  symptomatic  or  nonsymptomatic infrapatellar plicae. The infrapatellar plica can best be visualized in T2-weighted sagittal images without fat suppression where the structure will appear isointense in respect to the neighbouring ligamentous  structures  of  the  knee (14,28,30,35) . Cothran  et  al.  found  that  a  high  T2  signal  along

the course of the IPP that extended into Hoffa's fat pad was suggestive of a plica injury (13) . All four patients underwent an MRI of the knee and showed a thickened  infrapatellar plica. The combination of the  history,  examination  and  MRI  findings  in  this population will direct diagnosis. Intra-articular findings  during  knee  arthroscopy  consist  of  linear scratching  of  the  intercondylar  notch  at  the  site where the IPP slides back and forth over the cartilage (Fig.4).

## Infrapatellar fat pad syndrome

The  infrapatellar  fat  pad,  or  Hoffa's  fat  pad, is a richly vascularized and  innervated, extrasynovial  structure  in  the  anterior  compartment  of the knee. Though its' function is still not completely understood, it can be a cause of knee pain in athletes (30) .  The  pathophysiological  mechanism  has  been defined as 'impingement of the hypertrophic fat pad between  articular  surfaces  of  the  knee'  typically originating  from  forceful  hyperextension  of  the knee.  A  potential  cause  is  the  forceful  repetitive flexion  and  extension  movement occurring during cycling which leads to irritation, inflammation and oedema in the fat pad. This oedema could lead to an increase in volume and further impingement (5) . In our cohort, 3 cyclists were diagnosed with Hoffa impingement or inflammation.

Knee  pain  was  typically  located  infrapatellar, mostly more lateral or medial to the patella tendon.  Pain  could  typically  be  elicited  by  forced hyperextension of by direct pressure over the affected fat pad. MRI imaging can reveal oedema in the posterosuperior fat pad on T2 FS images and an inflamed infrapatellar bursa (18) .

In  our  study  MRI  imaging  showed  abnormal findings  (a  cyst  and  fat  pad  oedema)  in  two  of  3 patients. One  patient underwent  an ultrasound imaging showing inflammation.

The combination of clinical findings and imaging has  proven  to  be  conclusive  in  the  differential diagnosis for infrapatellar fat pad syndrome, patellofemoral pain, infrapatellar plica syndrome or patellar tendinopathy.

Treatment  consisted  of  a  therapeutic  corticosteroid injection into Hoffa's fat pad. If conservative treatment failed, an arthroscopic evaluation is warranted  where  the  hypertrophic  fat  pad  can  be resected.  This  procedure  was  performed  for  one patient in our series. In longstanding cases adhesions and fibrosis may occur (27) .

## Patellar tendinopathy

Five participants suffered patellar tendinopathy. Patellar  tendinopathy  or  jumper's  knee  is  not  a typical  bike  related  condition,  as  it  occurs  more often  in  jumping  sports.  In  cyclists,  poor  bike  fit (extrinsic)  or  tight  quadriceps  muscles  (intrinsic) are possible causes.

Diagnosis  is  mainly  clinical  but  can  be  aided by  ultrasound  or  MRI.  In  our  series  1  of  3  MRI investigations showed clear tendinosis and 1 out of 5  ultrasounds  demonstrated pathologic changes in the patellar tendon.

All  5  patients  were  treated  conservatively  with a  combination  of  physiotherapy  for  stretching  and excentric excercises, extracorporal shockwave treatment (2/5) or platelet-rich plasma injections (4/5).

Two professional cyclists returned to their preinjury competition level at their last follow up.

## Patello-femoral pain syndrome

None  of  our  patients  showed  clinical  evidence of  patello-femoral  pain  syndrome,  i.e.  no  pain during squatting, stair climbing or prolonged sitting  ('movie  sign').  Imaging  studies  showed no  significant  patellofemoral  chondral  damage  or patellofemoral malalignment in any of the patients.

## Medial sided knee pain

Medial Plica

The most frequent cause of medial sided knee pain in our patient cohort was the medial plica syndrome (15%) (35) .  Plicae  are  inward  folds  of  synovial lining  and  are  remnants  of  embryologic  synovial septae.  Although  the  presence  of  an  infrapatellar plica is more common than the medial parapatellar plica, the latter is more frequently symptomatic. The medial plica stretches over the medial condyle as a thin  elastic  band. An  inflammatory  response  after blunt trauma or repetitive friction can turn the plica into an inelastic fibrotic band causing impingement and friction over the medial condyle (35) .

The patients in our series reported a medial sided knee  pain  most  exclusively  during  cycling.  They could also sometimes feel rubbing of the plica itself. Clinical examination reveals a tender and swollen  cord  at  the  medial  parapatellar  border. Valgus  alignment,  tibia  internal  rotation  and  foot hyperpronation  can  increase  the  stretch  on  the medial structures (38) .  Although the diagnosis is  mainly  clinical,  MRI  imaging  can  reveal  the presence  and  extent  of  inflammation  of  the  plica. All three patients underwent MRI which confirmed presence of an inflamed or torn medial plica.

Pain free cycling after a local anaesthetic injection  may  confirm  the  diagnosis.  Treatment depends on the chronicity of the symptoms. In acute onset medial plica syndrome a short period of rest and  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  medication  is mandatory (33,35) .  The  authors  have  good  results with intra-plical injection of corticosteroids, which was performed successfully in 6 out of 8 patients. Two  patients  underwent  arthroscopic  resection  of the  medial  plica,  one  patient  after  failure  of  the conservative treatment and one patient who suffered from longstanding symptoms.

## Lateral sided knee pain

Biceps femoris friction syndrome and tendinopathy

Lateral sided knee pain is often caused by biceps femoris pathology. An abnormal anterior insertion of the biceps femoris tendon on the fibular head or a bony prominence on the fibular head can predispose to  snapping (26,29) .  One  study  found  that  5.8%

of  knee  overuse  injuries  in  professional  cyclists consisted  of  biceps  femoris  pathology (6) .  Biceps femoris  tendon  snapping  is  mainly  known  as    a runners' pathology (37) .

In our patient cohort 4 patients were diagnosed with biceps femoris friction over a prominent fibular head.

The clinical presentation of biceps femoris friction syndrome  is  characteristic. The  cyclist has  posterior  to  lateral  knee  pain  during  cycling. Pain  typically  persists  some  hours  after  training. Snapping of the biceps femoris tendon can be felt . We believe that 'biceps femoris friction syndrome' is part of the spectrum of snapping biceps syndrome sharing the same pathomechanics but without frank subluxation  of  the  tendon.  Friction  of  the  tendon leads to inflammation of the underlying bursa and tendinopathy. MRI shows tendinopathy of the biceps femoris tendon or fluid in the subtendinous bursa. X-ray  of  the  knee  may  demonstrate  fibular  head abnormalities like a prominent bony protuberance.

In all four patients MRI showed tendinopathy of the biceps femoris tendon (one longitudinal tear of the tendon). Ultrasound was positive in 2 of 4 cases. Radiographs confirmed a prominent fibular head in 3 of 4 participants.

Primary  treatment  is  mainly  conservative  consisting of rest and stretching. Lowering the saddle and putting the foot in some external rotation may also  alleviate  the  strain  and  friction  on  the  biceps femoris  tendon.  If  conservative  measures  fail,  a surgical release of the tendon with trimming of the prominence of the fibular head can be performed. Three patients of our cohort underwent this surgical procedure which led to complete pain relief.

## Iliotibial band syndrome

The iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a frequent overuse injury in both runners and cyclists (20,23,36) .

During  flexion  and  extension  of  the  knee  the position of the iliotibial band changes relative to the lateral  femur  condyle. At  the  bottom  of  the  pedal stroke,  around  30°  of  knee  flexion,  the  posterior fibres of the ITB are located over the lateral condyle near the edge of the impingement zone. Farrell et al. concluded that, although cyclists spent less time in the impingement zone at a lower force, the number

of  repetitions  is  the  primary  contributor  to  the development of ITBS in cyclists (21) .

Athletes usually complain of a stabbing lateralsided knee pain, arising during the course of a ride. Two patients suffered from iliotibial band syndrome in our cohort.

Clinical  examination  reveals  a  local  tenderness over the posterior fibres of the ITB with a positive Noble's  test.  The  Ober  test  is  used  to  evaluate ITB tightness. Although ITBS is a mainly clinical diagnosis,  medical  imaging  such  as  ultrasound and MRI can aid in the diagnosis by showing the presence of fluid in the underlying bursa (Fig.5).

Figure 5. - Coronal T2-weighted MRI image of a right knee showing the presence of hyperintense fluid in an inflamed bursa underlying the iliotibial band (circle) in a patient suffering ITB friction syndrome.

<!-- image -->

Two UCI U23 in our cohort suffered from ITB syndrome, both diagnoses were confirmed on MRI.

Treatment  for  ITBS  mainly  consists  of  conservative measures. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors  can  predispose  an  athlete  to  developing ITBS. Contributing intrinsic factors are leg length discrepancy, primary ITB tightness, external tibial rotation of more than 20°, varus knee alignment and foot overpronation (24) . Extrinsic factors should be addressed first, such as adjusting the bike fit and/or cleat positioning. A saddle position too high or too far back may increase the stretch on the ITB. A cleat which is too externally rotated (cycling toed-in) or lateral placed (adducted leg) may also cause ITBS. A  short  period  of  rest  is  often  advised  together with  stretching  of  the  ITB.  Local  infiltration  with corticoid  can  give  temporary  relief  but  should be  used  with  caution.  If  extensive  conservative treatment  fails,  iliotibial  band  bursectomy (22) is an  option.  Both  patients  in  our  series  underwent this surgery and returned to their previous level of racing.

## DISCUSSION

This  study  gives  a  comprehensive  diagnostic overview  of  cycling  overuse  injuries  of  the  knee. In contrast to many other studies the patellofemoral pain  syndrome,  although  often  cited  as  the  prime cause of anterior knee pain in cyclists, did not occur in our patient cohort.

Many  studies  have  reported  the  occurrence  of knee  overuse  injuries  in  cycling.  However,  only few outlined the possible underlying causes of knee overuse  injuries (6,8,15,23,38,39) .  Table  II  gives  an overview of the proposed differential diagnoses in literature.

Our  results  showed  that  for  a  total  of  53  elite cyclists' knees 7 different types of overuse injuries could  be  found  besides  the  patellofemoral  pain syndrome. In our experience over years dealing with high  level  cyclists,  patellofemoral  joint  pathology is  a  rather  uncommon  cause  of  knee  pain  in  high level cyclists and should only be determined when confirmed  by  medical  imaging.  In  the  absence  of patellofemoral  abnormalities  on  medical  imaging, other possible causes have to be considered. Table 3 gives an overview of the typical features for each syndrome  with  clinical examination,  diagnostic imaging and preferred treatment.

Although a possible explanation for the absence of  patellofemoral  pain  syndrome  in  this  study cohort could be the sample size or selection bias, we feel  that  there  are  significant  contradictions  in  the

clinical presentation and history that plead against patellofemoral pain syndrome as a common cause of  knee  complaints  in  high-level  cyclists.  Firstly, most cyclists consulting with a knee overuse injury complain of pain almost exclusively during cycling. There  is  no  typical  movie  sign,  or  pain  when walking stairs or during squatting as typically seen in  patellofemoral  pain  syndrome.  Secondly,  the main  treatment  for  patellofemoral  pain  syndrome consists of quadriceps strengthening exercises and cycling (9,19) . However, the quadriceps is definitely one  of  the  most  developed  muscles  in  high  level cyclists. Attributing  anterior  knee  pain  solely  to  a 'cyclists'  knee'  or  chondromalacia  patellae  in  a high mileage or professional cyclist often leads to a delayed diagnosis. These athletes are often treated with hyaluronic acid infiltrations and physiotherapy, with poor results.

cycling are friction related. Prepatellar friction syndrome  was  the  most  common  anterior  located knee  injury,  and  the  medial  plica  was  the  most common  medial  located  knee  injury.  These  syndromes  are  rare  clinical  entities  in  the  general population, but are more prevalent in high mileage cyclists, which  is intuitively explained by the extreme amount of pedalling revolutions performed by these athletes.

On the  other  hand,  our  results  suggest  that  the majority  of  overuse  injuries  around  the  knee  in

Limitations of this study are the relatively limited number  of  participants  and  a  single-centre  case series.  A  referral  and  selection  bias  might  skew the results to more surgically treated pathology. It is possible that some clinical entities are therefore underreported in our series if they are successfully treated by team doctors, general practitioners, physiotherapists  etc. We  acknowledge that certain syndromes are controversial or scarcely described in literature (infrapatellar plica friction syndrome, fat pad  impingement,  prepatellar  friction  syndrome),

however we tried to isolate a specific subpopulation of high mileage  and professional cyclists and outlined our diagnostic results.

## CONCLUSION

This is the first study which gives a prospective diagnostic  overview  of  overuse  injuries  in  highlevel cyclists. Our results show that friction related overuse injuries are a frequent and probably underrated  cause  of  knee  pain  in  high  level  cyclists. Patellofemoral  pain  syndrome,  though  often  suggested  as  a  primary  diagnosis  in  the  literature, seems to be unusual in high level cycling. Thorough history, clinical examination and additional imaging techniques  provide  the  ultimate  key  to  a  prompt and correct diagnosis. Successful treatment of the specific  type  of  overuse  injury  will  increase  the recovery  rate  and  ensure  rapid  return  to  pain-free cycling activities.
