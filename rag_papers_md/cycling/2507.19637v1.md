## Abstract

Assessment  of  muscle  coordination  during  cycling  may  provide  insight  into  motor  control strategies  and  movement  efficiency.  This  study  evaluated  muscle  synergies  and  coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination in lower-limb across three power levels of cycling.  Twenty  recreational  cyclists  performed  a  graded  cycling  test  on  a  stationary  bicycle ergometer.  Electromyography  was  recorded  bilaterally  from  seven  lower-limb  muscles  and muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The Coactivation Index (CI),  Synergy  Index  (SI),  and  Synergy  Coordination  Index  (SCI)  were  calculated  to  assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle synergies were identified consistently across power levels,  with  changes  in  synergy  composition  and  activation  timing  correlated  with  increased muscular demands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at the knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a greater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those of the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the  relative  EMG  contribution  of  hip  extensor  and  flexor  muscles  remained  consistent  with increasing power levels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting a  reduction in  the  size  of  the  synergy  space  and  improved neuromuscular coordination.  These findings provide insight into how the central nervous system modulates its response to increasing mechanical demands. Combining synergy and coactivation indices offers a promising approach to assess motor control, inform rehabilitation, and optimize performance in cycling tasks.

## 1. Introduction

Analysis of lower-limb joint motion is essential to understand human locomotion and activities such as cycling, to optimize human performance, and to develop injury prevention protocols [1]. Electromyography  (EMG)  signal  parameters,  such  as  the  coactivation  index  (CI)  and  cocontraction  index,  have  been  used  to  quantify  and  compare  muscle  activity  in  agonist  and antagonist  muscle  pairs  [1],  [2],  [3],  [4].  The  CI  measures  the  relative  activation  between opposing  muscle  groups  (e.g.,  flexors  and  extensors)  in  a  planar  movement,  while  the  cocontraction  index  assesses  the  degree  of  simultaneous  activation  of  paired  muscles,  reflecting joint stability and stiffness. However, these metrics cannot fully represent the synergists involved in joint motions and have been used primarily to analyze muscles in a single limb [5].

Human movement is orchestrated by the neural dynamics of the central nervous system (CNS), proprioceptors,  and  muscles.  The  inherent  redundancy  in  the  human  musculoskeletal  system grants the CNS the flexibility to select the most appropriate movement and muscle coordination for a given task from a vast set of possibilities [6], [7]. This capability is crucial for generating adaptive behaviors in daily life. The CNS organizes numerous degrees of freedom and resolves actuator redundancy in the musculoskeletal system [7]; by coordinating muscle groups, the CNS simplifies  the  control  of  these  degrees  of  freedom  [8].  Despite  progress  in  computational modeling, such as the development of models explaining biological control principles [9], [10], [11],  understanding  how  the  CNS  achieves  efficient  movement  remains  a  challenge.  One proposed mechanism is behavior training, which reduces redundancy and narrows the focus of the CNS to a smaller set of optimized movement options. Alnajjar et al. [12] demonstrated that training  enhances  stability  and  muscle  coordination,  enabling  the  CNS  to  optimize  movement patterns  and  reduce  unnecessary  actions.  This  mechanism  has  important  implications  for neurorehabilitation as it suggests that targeted training may streamline motor control strategies and improve recovery outcomes in individuals with motor impairments.

Muscle synergies are linear combinations of individual muscle activations that the CNS employs to  efficiently  produce  and  control  movement.  Muscle  synergy  theory  simplifies  the  highdimensional muscle activation space into a lower-dimensional synergy space. Each synergy is defined  by  a  fixed  set  of  weights  representing  the  relative  magnitudes  of  individual  muscle activations [13]. A synergy's activation profile is a time-dependent signal that shows how the synergy is recruited and modulated over time [13]. The number of synergies used to reconstruct the original EMG signals defines the 'synergy level' or the dimensionality of the model [13], [14],  [15].  The  CNS  organizes  muscle  activity  into  synergies,  groups  of  muscles  activated together, to efficiently control phases of movement, such as joint flexion and extension [5], [16].

A  muscle  synergy  analysis  can  identify  motor  actions  that  are  common  across  various  joint motions;  however,  validation  of  muscle  synergies  as  indicators  of  lower-limb  movement performance remains limited. This limitation arises from the complexity of neural and muscular interactions,  the  variability  of  synergies  across  individuals  and  tasks,  and  the  challenges  in obtaining  consistent  and  high-quality  EMG  data  [17].  Expanding  research  to  include  diverse conditions, populations, and longitudinal studies is essential to establish broader applicability of muscle synergy analysis [5]. Decomposition methods such as non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) can be used to extract synergies from EMG signals [17], [18]. Previous research [19], [20],  [21],  [22]  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  NNMF  over  other  dimensionality  reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), particularly for analyzing neuromuscular actions [19], [20], [21], [22]. One key advantage of  NNMF  lies  in  its  restriction  to  non-negative  weights,  which  aligns  with  the  physiological reality that muscle activations cannot be negative. Compared to PCA, NNMF not only captures neuromuscular patterns more effectively [20], [22], [23] but also provides results that are more clinically interpretable, offering insight into muscle synergies and coordination [24], [25]. These attributes  make  NNMF  a  preferred  method  for  understanding  and  modeling  neuromuscular control.  Accuracy  of  a  muscle  synergy  scheme  in  representing  a  group  of  muscle  functions depends on the EMG signal quality of dominant muscles and the number of synergy levels, and can be quantified using metrics such as the Variance Accounted For (VAF) [26].

Muscle synergy analysis has been used to provide a simplified representation of motor control for  many complex human movements. Examples include sit-to-stand [27], [28], walking [29], running  [30],  [31],  reaching  [32],  [33],  and  catching  [34].  Recent  studies  have  also  explored exercises such as treadmill walking [35], [36] and cycling [37], [38], [39], [40], supporting the hypothesis  that  simplified  motor  control  strategies  are  employed  during  these  activities.  For instance,  NNMF-based  muscle  synergies  have  been  used  to  study  muscle  fatigue  during squatting  [41]  and  to  investigate  the  effects  of  anterior  cruciate  ligament  (ACL)  injuries  on muscle recruitment patterns during walking [42]. In general, these studies have found consistent synergy  patterns  across  participants  and  tasks,  reflecting  shared  neural  mechanisms  for  motor control, while also identifying task-specific adjustments in muscle contributions to meet unique movement demands.

Cycling, as a rhythmic and kinematically constrained activity, provides a controlled environment for studying muscle synergies. Previous studies have demonstrated that a few robust and shared muscle  synergies  can  describe  muscle  coordination  during  pedaling  across  both  trained  and untrained  cyclists,  and  among  both  healthy  individuals  and  those  with  incomplete  spinal  cord injuries [43], [44]. The CNS  adapts its control mechanisms through flexible synergy combinations  in  response  to  kinematic  changes  (e.g.,  posture)  and  kinetic  changes  (e.g.,  joint torque) [43], [45]. For instance, Turpin et al. [44] demonstrated that distinct muscle coordination patterns during standing cycling and seated cycling allow the CNS to optimize muscle activation under varying power levels. Similarly, De Marchis et al. [45] demonstrated that although interindividual variability exists in cycling coordination strategies, common synergies are consistently used, reflecting the ability of the CNS to adapt modular control strategies to meet biomechanical demands. However, these studies identified a fixed set of muscle synergies for pedaling  under  steady  conditions  and  did  not  investigate  in  detail  the  dependence  of  synergy patterns on power level.

The aim of this study was to investigate muscle synergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination in lower-limb joints during cycling at varying power levels. By analyzing  the  consistency  of  synergies  across  power  levels,  we  quantified  the  phase  shifts  in synergy activation profiles with respect to crank angle. Additionally, we employed the Synergy Coordination Index (SCI) to evaluate the size of the synergy space, providing insight into the muscle coordination strategies  [12],  [46].  By  incorporating  the  Synergy  Index  (SI)  with  other muscle coactivation indices, we aimed to assess how the CNS optimizes synergy structures in response to varying muscle force demands. This study sought to extend the application of SCI and SI beyond static tasks to a dynamic and rhythmic cycling task, offering new perspectives on motor  control  adaptation  and  potential  clinical  implications  for  movement  assessment  and rehabilitation.

## 2. Methodology

The methodological framework was designed to systematically assess neuromuscular coordination during a cycling task with incrementally increasing power output. The experiments encompassed participant preparation, bilateral EMG recording from key lower-limb muscles, and a  structured  stepwise  power  protocol.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  1,  the  experimental  workflow

included EMG  acquisition,  signal  processing,  muscle  synergy  extraction, and  clustering, culminating in the calculation of three synergy-based indices: SI, SCI, and CI. This comprehensive approach enabled the  evaluation  of how muscle coordination strategies  evolve across a range of power levels during cycling. The limbs were analyzed separately to account for potential neuromuscular asymmetries.

## 2.1. Participants

This study included 20 adult amateur cyclists, comprising 8 males and 12 females (age 22.6 ± 4.5 years, height 171.8 ± 7.7 cm, mass 70.6 ± 12.5 kg; mean ± standard deviation). The inclusion criterion was the absence of any diagnosed locomotor or cardiopulmonary pathology that could hinder participants' ability to complete the test or influence the results. All participants provided written informed consent prior to the study, which was conducted at the Human Performance Laboratory of the University of Calgary. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Calgary Ethics Board (REB #23-1803).

## 2.2. Experimental protocol

Experiments were performed on a stationary cycling ergometer trainer (Echelon Connect EX-5, Echelon,  Vancouver,  Canada).  A  crank  encoder  (Model  LM13,  RLS,  Komenda,  Slovenia) measured crank angle at a sampling frequency of 250 Hz and was used to normalize the EMG signals to crank cycles. Participants were provided with cycling shoes with cleats; multiple sizes were made available for comfort. Cleats were aligned with the fat pad at the first metatarsal head

and their orientation was validated using cardboard shoe insoles to ensure consistency between the two feet.

EMG signals were recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles: vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris long head (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), and soleus (SOL). For each muscle, the subscripts 'D' and 'ND' (e.g., TAD) denote the dominant and non-dominant legs, respectively. EMG data were collected based  on  the  European  'SENIAM'  recommendations [47]. Briefly, the sensor location  on  the skin was shaved, cleaned with alcohol pads, and allowed to dry before sensor placement. EMG signals  were  collected  at  a  sampling  rate  of  2.2  kHz  using  a  wireless  Trigno  EMG  system (Delsys  Inc.,  Natick,  MA,  USA),  and  recorded  via  Trigno  Discover  software  (version  1.7.0). EMG data were synchronized with the encoder data to enable the analysis of muscle activation patterns relative to crank angles.

Participants completed a step test followed by a 3-minute warm-up period of cycling at 40 W and a  cadence  of  70  rpm.  Following  the  warm-up  period,  the  power  level  was  increased  in  20  W increments  every  minute,  starting  from  40  W,  until  the  participant  either  failed  to  sustain  the prescribed power level or decided to terminate the test. Power levels were displayed on a monitor and participants were verbally instructed to maintain the target power level.

## 2.3. Data Processing and Analysis

To  facilitate  comparison  across  participants,  EMG  data  were  normalized  with  respect  to  the dynamic maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The MVC was calculated for each muscle as the average of the top 10% of EMG magnitudes recorded during the test [49]. To remove the effects  of  power  level  transitions,  the  first  and  last  10%  of  cycles  at  each  power  level  were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 80% of the EMG data, comprising approximately 56 cycles per power level, were averaged over the crank angle to account for time shifts in EMG signals across cycles due to small variations in pedaling cadence. To monitor synergy variation across power levels, synergy parameters were calculated at three key points: the lowest power level (LPL), the middle power level (MPL), and the highest power level (HPL). The MPL was defined as half the maximum number of power levels (rounded down to the nearest integer if necessary).

The normalized EMG signals were high-pass filtered (30 Hz, zero-lag, fifth-order Butterworth), detrended, full-wave rectified, and low-pass filtered (10 Hz, zero-lag, fourth-order Butterworth) to  obtain  linear  envelopes  [38],  which  were  then  downsampled  from  2.2  kHz  to  250  Hz.  The resulting  filtered  and  downsampled  EMG  signals  were  processed  to  extract  synergy  weights, which  were  used  to  compute  two  indices:  the  SI  and  the  SCI.  The  SI  reflects  the  overall contribution  of  muscle  synergies  to  joint  motions;  the  SCI  quantifies  the  size  of  the  synergy space,  capturing  the  adaptability  and  complexity  of  muscle  coordination  strategies.  These  two indices provide a comprehensive assessment of muscle synergy and coordination during cycling tasks.

## 2.4. Synergy Analysis

The filtered and downsampled EMG signal obtained from each muscle was first divided by its standard  deviation  to  compute  unit  variance,  ensuring  equal  weighting  of  the  muscles  in  the synergy extraction process [48]. Muscle synergies were then extracted from the EMG data using NNMF with a multiplicative update rule:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where EMGm×n Exp contains  the  processed  experimental  EMG  data  recorded  at  each  power  level during pedaling (e.g., X VMD ); EMGm×n Rec is the reconstructed version of EMGm×n Exp , estimated using NNMF; Em×n EMG is  the  reconstruction  error; W(m×k) are  the  synergy  weights;  and H(k×n) are  the activation  profiles.  Here,  m  indicates  the  muscle  (VMD,  RFD,  VLD,  BFD,  TAD,  GMD,  SOLD, VMND, RFND, VLND, BFND, TAND, GMND, and SOLND), n denotes the EMG data point at each power  level,  and  k  represents  the  synergy  level.  Initial  non-negative  factors  W0  and  H0  were computed using the multiplicative update algorithm with 100 iterations and four synergy levels (k  =  4),  repeated  ten  times  [49].  Additionally,  the  alternating  least  squares  algorithm  was employed with 1000 iterations and ten repetitions to enhance the accuracy of the resulting nonnegative factors [5].

The criteria used to determine the number of muscle synergy levels included a combination of global and local variability of muscle activations, constrained by V AF, as suggested by Safavynia and Ting [50]:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ‖…‖F denotes the Frobenius norm of the matrix. The smallest number of synergies (k) that satisfied the V AF-based criteria was set as the decomposition level for the NNMF method. This  approach  ensured  that  the  extracted  synergies  effectively  captured  the  majority  of  the variance in muscle activation patterns while maintaining localized accuracy. After calculating the muscle  synergy  weights  (W)  and  activation  profiles  (H),  each  muscle's  contribution  within  a

synergy,  reflecting  its  relative  activation  level,  was  quantified  using  the  corresponding  weight values in W. To determine the reliability of these contributions, 95% confidence intervals were computed  for  each  muscle's  weight  within  each  synergy  using  a  bootstrapping  procedure. Muscles were considered significant contributors to a synergy if their 95% confidence interval did not include zero. Relative activation strength was computed as the normalized weight of each muscle within a synergy and was used to rank muscles by their relative activation levels. These rankings  were  then  compared  across  participants  and  synergies  using  cumulative  magnitude analysis, providing insight into the dominant muscle groups involved in each synergy [51].

Because  the  obtained  synergies  appeared  in  an  arbitrary  order  across  participants,  k-means clustering was used to label the synergies [52], [53]. To increase consistency within each cluster, participant  data  were  excluded  if  two  synergies  were  assigned  to  the  same  cluster  or  if  the correlation of a synergy with the cluster mean was below 0.61, in accordance with α = 0.02 for a sample size of 14 [54]. To ensure the k-means solution was globally optimal and independent of initial  conditions,  clustering  was  repeated  100  times  using  different  randomly  selected  initial centroids and the result that was obtained most frequently was retained.

To  investigate  the  temporal  changes  in  synergy  activation  profiles  across  power  levels,  we employed a cross-correlation-based estimate of phase shift [55]. This method quantified phase shifts, in degrees, between synergy activation profiles that were common across power levels. To further  examine  the  role  of  synergies  in  cycling  mechanics,  the  revolution  of  the  crank  was divided  into  four  quadrants:  early  downstroke  (ED,  0°  to  90°),  late  downstroke  (LD,  90°  to 180°),  early  upstroke  (EU,  180°  to  270°),  and  late  upstroke  (LU,  270°  to  360°).  Angles  were measured  with  respect  to the location of the pedal of the  non-dominant  leg,  with  0° corresponding to the top dead center. This segmentation enabled a detailed analysis of muscle activation patterns throughout the pedaling cycle.

## 2.5. Indices for Analyzing Muscle Synergy

## 2.5.1. Synergy Index (SI)

To calculate SI, a synergy structure was formed by selecting the largest synergy weight for each of the fourteen muscles across the four synergy levels:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the subscripts and superscripts of the synergy weights indicate, respectively, the muscle name and the corresponding synergy group. The joint-specific SI was defined as the ratio of the sum  of  the  largest  synergy  weights  of  the  flexor  muscles  ( Wflex )  to  the  sum  of  the  synergy weights of all muscles that generate moments at that joint:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The  SI  values  for  the  hip  ( SI hip ),  knee  ( SI knee ),  and  ankle  ( SI ankle )  joints  were  calculated  as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 2.5.2. Synergy Coordination Index (SCI)

SCI was used to evaluate the dimensionality of the resulting synergy space, which quantifies the coordination among the extracted synergies. The synergy weight matrix W can be expressed as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where  each W (i) ∈ ℝ m is  a  basis  vector  of  the  synergy  space,  with  k  =  4.  Since  the  NNMF algorithm was used to estimate W (i) , the synergy vectors had only non-negative components. In general, the vectors W (i) are not mutually orthogonal. The size of the synergy space depends on the angles between the vectors that form its spanning set. To quantify the size of the synergy

space, the Synergy Coordination Index (SCI) was defined using the average of the pairwise inner products between the normalized synergy vectors:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P(k , 2) denotes the number of 2-permutations of k elements (with k = 4 in the present study),  and  ' ∙ '  indicates  the  vector  dot  product.  The  SCI  ranges  from  0  to  1.  An  SCI  of  1 indicates that the W (i) vectors are identical, meaning that the synergy space has collapsed into a line.  Conversely,  an  SCI  of  0  indicates  that  the W (i) vectors  are  mutually  orthogonal  and  the synergy space is of maximal size. Thus, as the SCI increases, the synergy space becomes smaller due to greater cosine similarity between synergy vectors; a small value of the SCI indicates a larger synergy space and higher dimensionality in muscle coordination.

## 2.5.3 Coactivation Index (CI)

The CI of the hip, knee, and ankle joints (CIhip, CIknee, and CIankle, respectively) was computed as the ratio of the integrated EMG signals (iEMG) from the flexor muscles to the total integrated EMG signals from both flexor and extensor muscles:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the EMG signals were preprocessed by filtering and downsampling, and then integrated over the crank angle [5], [16]. In this study, the focus was on critical phases in the pedaling cycle that  were  characterized  by  substantial  mechanical  demands  at  the  hip,  knee,  and  ankle  joints. These critical phases were considered as the periods during which each joint experienced at least 80% of its maximum net moment. Based on joint moment data reported in prior studies [56], [57], high mechanical demand was observed at the hip between 70° and 170° of crank rotation, measured from the top dead center (TDC = 0°). Similar demands were reported for the knee from 15° to 75°, and for the ankle from 80° to 150°. A CI value greater than 0.5 indicates greater EMG activity from the flexor muscles while a value less than 0.5 indicates greater EMG activity from the extensor muscles [16], [53].

## 2.6. Statistical Analysis

The  normality  of  the  data  was  assessed  using  the  Shapiro-Wilk  test  and  the  assumption  of normality was confirmed (p &gt; 0.05 for all variables). A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted  to  examine  changes  across  three  power  levels  [58].  For  comparisons  between  two specific  power  levels,  paired-sample  t -tests  were  performed.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  any

reported statistically significant difference refers to a comparison with the  lowest power level. When  significance  refers  to  a  comparison  between  other  pairs  of  power  levels,  the  specific groups are indicated. Statistical  significance  was  set  at  p  &lt;  0.05. All  analyses  were  conducted using Python (version 3.13).

## 3.1. Muscle Synergies

The minimum number of synergies that satisfied the criteria  of Eq.  (5)  was k  = 4  (Figure 3). Applying  the  four  identified  synergy  structures  to  the  processed  EMG  data  across  all  power levels resulted in a reconstruction accuracy of VAFGlobal &gt; 0.95 and VAFLocal &gt; 0.70, R² &gt; 0.62. These findings confirm that four muscle  synergies provide a robust lower-dimensional representation of muscle coordination patterns across all power levels.

Synergy  1  (Figure  4a)  primarily  included  the  non-dominant  quadriceps,  which  were  active during the ED phase. Additionally, SOLD and TAND were active during this phase. The muscle composition of Synergy 1 varied notably across power levels. In the LPL group, the synergy was dominated  by  VLND,  VMND,  SOLD,  TAND,  and  RFND.  At  MPL,  VLND  and  VMND  exhibited significantly  greater  activity  than  at  LPL  (p  &lt;  0.05).  At  HPL,  BFD  activity  was  significantly greater than it was at LPL (p &lt; 0.05), indicating greater hamstring involvement at greater cycling intensity.  Moreover,  as the power  level increased, the  contribution  of  SOLD  decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05).

Synergy 2 (Figure 4b) primarily included muscles  that  were  active  during  the  LD  phase.  The main  contributors  across  all  power  levels  were  GMND,  TAD,  and  TAND,  muscles  known  for stabilizing the ankle and facilitating smooth force transfer [59]. SOLND and BFND were also key contributors  in  both  the  LPL  and  MPL  groups.  At  HPL,  BFND  activity  significantly  increased compared to LPL (p &lt; 0.05) and exhibited greater weight than SOLND; in contrast, GMND weight significantly  decreased  from  LPL  to  HPL.  These  changes  indicate  increased  posterior  thigh muscle activity during increased cycling intensity.

Synergy 3 (Figure 4c) primarily included muscles that were active during the EU phase. The primary contributors to Synergy 3 (VMD, VLD, RFD, SOLND, and SOLD) were consistent at LPL and MPL. However, at HPL, the weight of RFD increased (p &lt; 0.05) while the contributions from SOLND and SOLD decreased (p &lt; 0.05), indicating a shift toward quadriceps activity during the EU  phase.  Synergy  4  (Figure  4d)  was  contralateral  to  Synergy  2  and  consisted  primarily  of

muscles that  were  active  during  the  LU  phase.  The  primary  contributors  to  Synergy  4  (GMD, SOLD, BFD, TAD, and TAND) were consistent across all power levels, supporting pedal recovery and limb elevation.  At  HPL, the weights of RFND and TAND increased whereas the weight of GMD decreased (p &lt; 0.05).

LPL: lowest power level (60 W); MPL: middle power level (midway between LPL and HPL); HPL: highest power level. The pedaling cycle is divided into four phases: early downstroke (0° to 90°), late downstroke (90° to180°), early upstroke (180° to 270°), and late upstroke (270° to 360°). Angles are measured with respect to the location of the pedal of the non-dominant leg, with 0° corresponding to the top dead center. The five most prominent contributors to each synergy are highlighted (right).

The synergy activation profiles showed strong correlations between LPL and MPL, and between LPL  and  HPL,  with  r  &gt;  0.86  ±  0.13  across  module  pairs.  However,  a  comparison  of  these correlations  revealed  that  LPL-to-HPL  consistently  exhibited  lower  correlations  than  LPL-toMPL  (i.e.,  correlation  between  activation  profiles  decreased  as  power  level  increased).  For example,  in  Synergy  4,  the  LPL-to-MPL  correlation  was  0.98  ±  0.02  and  the  LPL-to-HPL

correlation was 0.88 ± 0.09. Cross-correlation analysis was used to identify phase shifts between activation profiles of the same synergy across power levels (Table 1). While a phase shift was observed in all synergies, the shift was statistically significant for only Synergy 2 and Synergy 4. In  Synergy  2,  the  shift  increased  from  0.92°  ±  1.80°  to  2.38°  ±  5.22°  across  power  levels;  in Synergy 4, the shift increased from 4.85° ± 4.32° to 17.92° ± 11.75°.

## 3.2. Synergy Index (SI)

The synergy outcomes at the hip, knee, and ankle joints were quantified using the SI calculated from Eqs. (7)-(10) (Figure 5). Recall that SI values greater than 0.5 indicate a predominance of the synergy weights of the flexor muscles, while values below 0.5 indicate a predominance of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles. Joint-specific contributions were assessed across the three power levels.

At the hip, mean SI values were close to 0.5 across all power levels, indicating an approximately equal contribution of the synergy weights of the flexor and extensor muscles at the hip. For the non-dominant hip, SI values were 0.44 ± 0.08 at LPL, 0.47 ± 0.17 at MPL, and 0.49 ± 0.17 at HPL; for the dominant hip, SI values were 0.50 ± 0.11 at LPL, 0.56 ± 0.15 at MPL, and 0.54 ± 0.15 at HPL. Statistically significant asymmetry was detected at MPL (p = 0.020), indicating a greater contribution of the synergy weights of flexor muscles relative to extensor muscles on the dominant leg at the middle power level.

At the knee, a clear trend was observed from predominance of the synergy weights of the flexor muscles at low power to predominance of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles at higher power. For the non-dominant knee, SI decreased significantly from 0.57 ± 0.09 at LPL to 0.47 ± 0.11  at  MPL  (p  &lt;  0.05),  and  further  to  0.42  ±  0.07  at  HPL  (p  &lt;  0.05).  The  dominant  knee followed a similar pattern, with SI decreasing from 0.47 ± 0.07 at LPL to 0.36 ± 0.10 at MPL (p &lt; 0.05), and further to 0.34 ± 0.05 at HPL (p &lt; 0.05). Significant side-to-side differences were observed at all three power levels, with consistently greater extensor dominance in the dominant knee (p &lt; 0.05 at all power levels).

At  the  ankle,  a  predominance  of  synergy  weights  of  the  extensor  muscles  (SI  &lt;  0.5)  was observed on both legs across all power levels. Interestingly, SI values increased as power level increased, opposite to the pattern observed at the knee. For the non-dominant ankle, SI increased significantly from 0.15 ± 0.05 at LPL to 0.18 ± 0.08 at MPL, and further to 0.31 ± 0.12 at HPL (p &lt; 0.05). The dominant ankle showed a similar trend, with SI increasing significantly from 0.19 ±

0.09 at LPL to 0.23 ± 0.08 at MPL, and further to 0.27 ± 0.10 at HPL (p &lt; 0.05). At the ankle, no significant differences in SI were observed between sides, across power levels.

## 3.3. Synergy Coordination Index (SCI)

The  SCI  was  calculated  separately  for  each  power  level  to  assess  changes  in  the  structure  of muscle coordination. SCI values showed a progressive increase with  increasing power output: 0.08 ± 0.04 at LPL, 0.13 ± 0.08 at MPL, and 0.24 ± 0.11 at HPL. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences among all three conditions (p &lt; 0.05), demonstrating that power level had a  significant  effect  on  the  size  of  the  synergy  space.  This  trend  in  the  SCI  indicates  greater similarity among synergy vectors and a reduction in the dimensionality of muscle coordination at higher  cycling  intensities.  In  other  words,  as  cycling  intensity  increased,  muscle  activation patterns became more consistent across the synergy space.

## 3.4. Coactivation Index (CI)

The CI for the hip, knee, and ankle is shown in Figure 6Figure 6 at all three power levels. For the hip,  CI  values  were  relatively  consistent  across  power  levels.  On  the  non-dominant  limb,  CI values were 0.37 ± 0.20 (LPL), 0.30 ± 0.10 (MPL), and 0.30 ± 0.12 (HPL); on the dominant limb, CI values were 0.39 ± 0.18 (LPL), 0.37 ± 0.15 (MPL), and 0.39 ± 0.16 (HPL). Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in hip joint synergy across power levels (p &gt; 0.05). Between-limb  differences  in  CI  at  the  LPL  were  not  significant  at  the  hip.  A  significant difference  appeared  at  MPL  (p  &lt;  0.05)  and  became  more  pronounced  at  HPL  (p  &lt;  0.02),

indicating  an  increase  in  asymmetry  with  an  increase  in  power  level.  In  contrast,  there  were significant reductions in CI values at the knee as the power level increased. The non-dominant knee CI decreased from 0.33 ± 0.18 (LPL) to 0.22 ± 0.13 (MPL, p &lt; 0.05) to 0.19 ± 0.09 (HPL, p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the dominant knee CI decreased from 0.28 ± 0.13 (LPL) to 0.18 ± 0.07 (MPL, p &lt; 0.05) to 0.17 ± 0.06 (HPL, p &lt; 0.05). These trends suggest increased recruitment of the knee extensor  muscles  at  higher  power  levels.  No  significant  between-limb  differences  in  CI  were found at the knee. At the ankle, CI values increased significantly as power level increased. On the non-dominant limb, the ankle CI increased from 0.19 ± 0.09 (LPL) to 0.23 ± 0.07 (MPL, p &lt; 0.05) to 0.33 ± 0.11 (HPL, p &lt; 0.05). On the dominant limb, the ankle CI increased from 0.13 ± 0.06 (LPL) to 0.19 ± 0.10 (HPL, p &lt; 0.05), though the difference between MPL and HPL was not statistically  significant. Significant  between-limb differences in ankle CI were observed across all power levels (p &lt; 0.05).

The circular schematics below each boxplot illustrate the crank cycle, with shaded arcs indicating periods during which each joint generated at least 80% of its peak net joint moment.

## 4. Discussion

## 4.1. Muscle Synergy Composition Across Power Levels

The results of this study indicate that muscle synergy structure during  cycling depends on the power level. In terms of composition, similar synergies were observed across all power levels (LPL,  MPL,  and  HPL),  indicating  preservation of the modular  organization of  muscle coordination.  However,  clear  changes  in  muscle  weighting  within  each  synergy  emerged  with increasing  intensity,  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  For  example,  the  first  and  third  synergies,  which involve  primarily  knee  extensors  and  hip  extensors,  showed  increased  weighting  of  the hamstrings and quadriceps (particularly the  rectus femoris)  at  higher power levels. This  result suggests that there is greater reliance on these muscles to meet elevated torque demands at higher power  levels.  Conversely,  the  second  and  fourth  synergies,  which  were  dominated  by  the hamstrings and ankle dorsiflexors, demonstrated an increase in hamstring contribution as power level increased. This shift was accompanied by a significant reduction in gastrocnemius medialis weighting, suggesting a functional reorganization of the synergy structure to accommodate the demands of higher workloads.

Our hypothesis was that when pedaling at a constant cadence and the power demand is increased, propulsive muscle force must increase. Consequently, one might expect to observe phase shifts in muscle activations as it takes time to activate a muscle and allow its force to reach the required magnitude.  Based  on  our  results,  significant  workload-induced  temporal  adaptations  were observed in  the  activation  profiles  of  the  second  and  fourth  synergies  across  power  levels,  as evidenced by cross-correlation phase shifts and  Pearson correlation coefficients between  LPL, MPL, and HPL (Table 1). Synergy 2 exhibited moderate but statistically significant  advanced phase shifts in activation timing with increased workload, showing a crank cycle shift of 2.38° ± 5.22°  between  LPL  and  HPL  (p  &lt;  0.05).  Despite  this  phase  shift,  the  Pearson  correlation remained high, decreasing only slightly from 0.98 ± 0.01 (LPL to MPL) to 0.95 ± 0.05 (LPL to HPL), indicating relatively consistent activation patterns regardless of power level. In contrast, Synergy 4 showed more pronounced temporal adaptations, with statistically significant advanced phase  shifts  of  17.92°  ±  11.75°  from  LPL  to  HPL  (p  &lt;  0.05).  Correspondingly,  the  Pearson correlation decreased significantly from 0.98 ± 0.02 (LPL to MPL) to 0.88 ± 0.09 (LPL to HPL; p  &lt;  0.05),  suggesting  a  notable  reorganization  of  activation  dynamics  at  higher  power  levels. Synergies 1 and 3 showed high Pearson correlation coefficients-Synergy 1: 0.91 ± 0.08 (LPL to MPL), 0.86 ± 0.13 (LPL to HPL); Synergy 3: 0.95 ± 0.04 (LPL to MPL), 0.91 ± 0.10 (LPL to HPL)-indicating  a  high  degree  of  waveform  similarity  across  workloads.  However,  no statistically significant phase shifts (p &gt; 0.05) were observed for either Synergy 1 or Synergy 3 with increasing power level. These modest temporal adjustments agree with previous findings, which report only moderate timing shifts in primary power-generating synergies in response to increased  cycling  loads  [37],  [45].  This  trend  is  expected,  given  the  electromechanical  delay between neural activation and force production [60], and may also vary across individuals due to differences in muscle properties, coordination strategies, and motor unit recruitment [45]. These changes  in  activation  timing  likely  reflect  the  adaptive  strategy  used  by  the  CNS  to  optimize muscle engagement and improve power transfer efficiency during high-intensity cycling. Such

phase advancements and broader activation profiles have been well documented in the literature as characteristic responses to increasing mechanical demands during cycling [37], [61], [62].

The  findings  of  our  study  agree  with  and  extend  the  existing  literature  on  muscle  synergies during cycling. Hug et al. [43] found that muscle coordination during pedaling in trained cyclists could  be  explained  by  three  synergies  that  were  remarkably  consistent  across  individuals. Notably, interindividual differences in surface EMG patterns did not correspond to differences in synergy  structure;  all  cyclists  employed  similar  synergies  to  generate  pedaling  force.  This observation supports the hypothesis that muscle modules for cycling are task invariant. In our study,  the  similarity  of  synergies  across  cycling  intensities  further  supports  the  task-invariant hypothesis of muscle modules. Indeed, synergy overlap across power levels was high: each LPL synergy could be matched to a counterpart at MPL and HPL, consistent with the high betweencondition correlations observed in Table 1 for most synergies. Similarly, prior work by Esmaeili and  Maleki  [40]  reported  high  similarity  in  muscle  synergy  vectors  (average  correlation  of approximately 0.88) across a range of cadences and resistances. Together, these results suggest that  the  CNS  relies  on  a  stable  set  of  muscle  groupings  during  cycling,  even  as  mechanical demands vary. However, our findings also reveal that within this stable set, the relative weighting of individual muscles may vary with power level. This observation aligns with previous studies showing  that  the  required  effort  affects  the  relative  contribution  of  individual  muscles.  For example, Enders et al. [63] reported that doubling the pedaling workload from 150 W to 300 W led to shifts in individual muscle contributions, while the overall activation patterns were largely preserved. In our data, the effect of increased workload on individual muscle contributions was observed as increased weighting of the quadriceps muscles, particularly the rectus femoris, and a concurrent decrease in gastrocnemius medialis contribution at HPL compared to LPL (Figure 4), indicating muscle-specific adaptations in synergy composition.

Overall,  these  findings  demonstrate  a  flexible  and  nuanced  temporal  modulation  by  the  CNS, selectively adjusting the activation profiles of certain synergies, particularly Synergies 2 and 4, to effectively meet the increased mechanical demands when power level was increased.

## 4.2. Flexor-Extensor Dominance and Functional Adaptation across Power Levels

In  the  context  of  this  study,  the  SI  quantifies  the  relative  contribution  of  the  synergy  weights associated  with  flexor  and  extensor  muscle  groups  at  a  joint,  effectively  indicating  whether  a joint's  motor  output  is  dominated  by  flexors  or  extensors.  Liu  et  al.  [64]  demonstrated  that walking speed influences the lower-limb SI: the index was greater at faster speeds than slower speeds, suggesting that the balance between flexor and extensor muscle activity depends on the mechanical demand. Similarly, in our study, SI values changed systematically with power level: as  workload  increased,  the  neuromuscular  system  adjusted  the  recruitment  of  flexors  versus extensors to meet task demands. In essence, SI offers a robust window into how the CNS adjusts muscle group contributions to match the power requirements of the task.

Previous research has shown  that during  maximum-effort  cycling, power  production  is distributed approximately as follows: 40% from the hip, 40% from the knee, 15% from the ankle, and 5% from the trunk and upper limbs [65]. This distribution highlights the hip's substantial contribution to propulsion. We observed a balanced relative contribution of the synergy weights

associated  with  flexor  and  extensor  muscle  groups  at  the  hip  (i.e.,  SI  of  approximately  0.5) across  power  levels,  attesting  to  the  hip's  central  role  in  postural  control  and  efficient  force transmission. A significant asymmetry was observed at MPL (SI = 0.56 ± 0.15; Figure 5), which may reflect  the  fact  that  the  dominant  limb  often  exhibits  greater  capacity  for  neuromuscular control than the non-dominant limb (e.g., people are more coordinated when kicking a ball with their dominant leg than with their non-dominant leg) [66].

At the knee, a pronounced transition from greater synergy weights of the flexor muscles at low cycling intensity (SI &gt; 0.5 at LPL) to greater synergy weights of the extensor muscles at higher intensities (SI &lt; 0.5 at MPL and HPL) was observed, particularly on the dominant side (LPL: SI =  0.34  ±  0.05;  Figure  5). As  the  power  demand  increased,  muscle  activity  shifted  toward  the quadriceps  (knee  extensors),  which  are  primarily  responsible  for  producing  torque  during  the downstroke. This pattern aligns with previous EMG studies that found disproportionately greater quadriceps  activation  at  higher  power  levels  [67],  [68].  The  persistent  dominance  of  the dominant-knee  extensors  (p  &lt;  0.05  across  all  conditions)  may  reflect  side-specific  strength differences or pedaling mechanics that favor the dominant limb during power generation. Such asymmetry,  especially  in  recreational  cyclists,  may  increase  the  risk  of  overuse  injuries, highlighting the importance of targeted bilateral training to restore balance [69]. These findings are consistent with motor control principles suggesting that the CNS prioritizes the activation of the main power-generating muscles during high-demand activities (e.g., quadriceps during HPL) while  also  minimizing  antagonist  coactivation  to  maximize  net  joint  torque  and  metabolic efficiency.

The  ankle's  consistently  extensor-dominant  Synergy  Index  (SI  &lt;  0.5)  across  all  power  levels underscores the critical role of the ankle plantarflexors (gastrocnemius medialis and soleus) in generating  propulsive  force  during  cycling.  However,  the  significant  increase  in  SI  as  cycling intensity increased (Figure 5) indicates increased recruitment of dorsiflexors (primarily tibialis anterior)  to  stabilize  the  ankle  during  forceful  plantarflexion.  This  coactivation  may  enhance joint  stiffness  and  control  during  high-load  conditions.  The  absence  of  significant  side-to-side differences (p &gt; 0.05) points to a symmetrical control strategy at the ankle, possibly due to its more constrained and mechanically consistent role in the kinetic chain compared to the hip and knee  [70].  This  adaptable  pattern,  prioritizing  extensor-driven  propulsion  while  integrating flexors  for  stabilization,  reflects  the  hierarchical  approach  of  the  CNS  to  balance  force  output with joint integrity.

## 4.3. Neuromuscular Control Strategy Adaptations at Higher Power

The SCI offers valuable insight into understanding neuromuscular control strategy adaptations. Alnajjar et al. [12] introduced SCI as a measure of how similar the synergy activations are, with larger SCI values indicating a smaller synergy space (i.e., a greater overlap or similarity among synergies).  In  this  context,  a  greater  SCI  reflects  a  more  focused  neural  control  strategy, characterized  by  the  consistent  recruitment  of  specific  combinations  of  muscles.  Training  and skill acquisition have been associated with increases in SCI and related metrics, suggesting that experts  exhibit  more  stable  synergy  composition  and  timing  than  novices  [12].  In  our  study, increasing  power  level  produced  a  similar  effect  as  increasing  skill  demand:  it  led  to  greater

coordination and reduced variability among synergies, and earlier, more synchronized synergy profiles,  culminating  in  a  greater  SCI.  This  pattern  suggests  that  exposure  to  high-intensity cycling  may  itself  serve  as  a  form  of  training,  promoting  a  more  expert-like  neuromuscular coordination profile. Conversely, failure to adapt synergy coordination at higher intensities could signal a less flexible or less developed control strategy. Overall, the neuromuscular adaptations observed in our study reflect a hierarchical control model in which the CNS maintains a core set of  muscle  synergies,  likely  generated  by  central  pattern  generators,  and  modulates  their activation  timing  and  weighting  in  a  context-sensitive  manner.  This  combination  of  preserved modular  structure  and  flexible  modulation  exhibits  the  hallmarks  of  efficient  motor  control: balancing  the  stability  of  learned  coordination  patterns  with  the  adaptability  required  to  meet changing mechanical demands.

## 4.4 Joint-specific Coactivation Patterns and Neuromuscular Strategies during Cycling

The CI at the hip remained similar across power levels. This observation suggests that agonistantagonist muscle engagement at the hip is regulated in a consistent manner to maintain pelvic stability  and  enable  efficient  force  transfer  over  a  range  of  workloads.  However,  a  significant difference  in  CI  between  the  non-dominant  and  dominant  hips  at  HPL  may  point  to  subtle asymmetries that emerge only under high mechanical demand. One possible explanation is limb dominance (i.e., a habitual preference for one leg), which may become more pronounced under intense  conditions.  Alternatively,  these  differences  may  reflect  slight  variations  in  technique, muscle fatigue, or compensation strategies adopted when sustaining high power levels. Minor side-to-side  differences  in  muscle  coordination  are  not  uncommon  in  cycling. Although  welltrained  cyclists  generally  exhibit  more  symmetric  pedaling  force  profiles  [71]  and  more consistent  synergy  patterns  than  novices  [43],  subtle  bilateral  differences  in  muscle  activation and coordination variability have been reported [61], [72].

In  contrast  to  the  hip,  a  clear  decrease  in  CI  was  observed  at  the  knee  as  cycling  intensity increased.  Significantly  lower  CI  values  were  observed  at  the  knee  at  HPL  compared  to  LPL, indicating more efficient neuromuscular control under high mechanical demand. This observation  suggests  that  as  power  demand  increases,  the  CNS  reduces  antagonist  muscle activity (e.g., hamstring engagement that would otherwise oppose quadriceps contraction during the  critical  phase  from  15°  to  75°),  thereby  optimizing  the  production  of  net  joint  torque. (However, it is important to note that biarticular muscles, such as the hamstrings, may still need to  be  active  to  generate  extension  moments  at  the  hip  joint,  and  their  contribution  depends  on both  crank  position  and  inter-joint  coordination.)  This  interpretation  aligns  with  the  broader motor  control  literature,  which  associates  high-efficiency  or  skilled  movement  with  low coactivation.  For  example,  Chapman  et  al.  [73]  observed  that  less-trained  cyclists  exhibited greater coactivation at higher cadences whereas highly trained cyclists maintained low coactivation  regardless  of  cadence.  Similarly,  the  observed  reduction  in  knee  CI  from  LPL  to HPL in our study suggests that participants adopted a more power-efficient activation strategy under  greater  workloads,  selectively  reducing  unnecessary  antagonist  activation  to  improve movement economy.

At the ankle, the CI increased  as cycling intensity increased, which  was opposite to the trend observed at the knee. At low intensity, the muscles crossing the ankle exhibited relatively low coactivation,  but  as  workload  increased,  so  too  did  the  antagonistic  activity  of  the  ankle dorsiflexors. Increasing CI at the ankle as cycling intensity increased may reflect a neuromuscular  strategy  aimed  at  increasing  joint  stability  under  greater  force  demands.  Cocontraction  increases  joint  stiffness,  which  is  beneficial  at  the  ankle  during  forceful  pedaling because  a  stiffer  ankle  more  effectively  transmits  power  and  absorbs  greater  forces  from  the pedal  [74],  [75].  In  essence,  the  body  'braces'  the  ankle  by  activating  both  agonists  and antagonists to increase joint stiffness. Use of antagonistic coactivation to improve joint stability during high-demand tasks is well documented in the biomechanics literature [74]. For example, simulations  of  gait  on  slippery  surfaces  have  shown  that  increased  lower-limb  coactivation enhances  stability  [76].  In  general,  muscle  co-contraction  is  known  to  increase  joint  stiffness which  results  in  reduced  joint  excursions  upon  a  perturbation,  but  this  strategy  comes  at  the expense of an increased energetic cost [74], [75], [76]. The side-to-side differences in ankle CI, where  the  dominant  ankle  consistently  showing  greater  extensor  activation  than  the  nondominant,  may  reflect  limb-specific  neuromuscular  strategies.  While  leg  dominance  is  one potential explanation, other factors such as differences in neuromuscular control, joint stiffness regulation,  or  habitual  movement  asymmetries  may  also  contribute. Although  our  participants were not trained athletes, prior studies have shown that even trained individuals can exhibit legspecific  neuromuscular  patterns  [72].  Together,  these  findings  suggest  that  the  CNS  tailors coactivation  not  only  to  task  intensity  but  also  potentially  to  individual  limb-specific  control strategies,  ensuring  that  ankle  stability  is  prioritized  under  high  power  demands  and  revealing that the muscles on one limb may coactivate more to achieve that stability.

This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted on a relatively small and homogeneous sample  of  young,  healthy  recreational  cyclists,  which  may  limit  the  generalizability  of  the findings. While the chosen participant group reduced inter-participant variability, the observed muscle  coordination  strategies  may  not  extend  to  other  populations,  such  as  trained  athletes, older  adults,  or  individuals  with  neuromuscular  impairments.  Second,  all  experiments  were performed in a controlled laboratory setting using a stationary cycle ergometer, which does not replicate the physiological and environmental complexity of real-world cycling. Factors such as terrain  variability,  postural  adjustments,  fatigue  accumulation,  balance  demands,  and  wind, which were absent in our experimental setup, may influence muscle coordination patterns. Future studies  should  aim  to  evaluate  synergy  coordination  and  joint-level  indices  in  more  natural conditions,  including  prolonged  and  outdoor  cycling  tasks.  Third,  surface  EMG  was  used  to record activity from a small number of superficial muscles, excluding deeper muscles as well as some  key  contributors  to  pedaling  mechanics,  such  as  the  gluteus  maximus.  EMG  is  also susceptible  to  signal  crosstalk  and  provides  only  a  qualitative  estimate  of  the  corresponding muscle  forces,  making  synergy-based  interpretations  only  approximations  of  the  underlying neuromuscular propulsive force and torque output. Finally, the joint-specific indices (CI, SI, and SCI) were derived from EMG signals without concurrent measurements of joint kinematics or kinetics.  As  such,  we  were  unable  to  directly  assess  how  muscle  activity  and  coordination correlate  with  joint  torques,  pedal  forces,  or  mechanical  efficiency.  Future  research  should integrate  EMG  with  motion  capture,  force  sensors,  or  musculoskeletal  modeling  to  provide

deeper  insight  into  the  biomechanics  of  cycling  and  to  validate  these  indices  as  indicators  of motor control efficacy in both healthy and clinical populations.

## 5. Conclusion

This  study  investigated  muscle  coordination  strategies  during  cycling  by  analyzing  muscle synergies and joint-specific coactivation patterns  at three power levels, providing insights into how the CNS modulates neuromuscular control in response to increasing mechanical demands. The  results  demonstrate  that  while  the  core  synergy  structure  remained  consistent  across intensities,  underscoring  the  stability  of  modular  motor  control,  distinct  changes  in  muscle weighting,  activation  timing,  and  muscle  coordination  emerged,  particularly  within  synergies associated with the late downstroke and late upstroke phases.

At the joint level, unique coactivation and flexor-extensor dominance patterns were observed. The  hip  maintained  similar  coactivation  and  balanced  synergy  contributions  across  all  power levels,  providing  evidence  of  its  role  in  postural  support  and  force  transmission. At  the  knee, reduced coactivation and a clear transition toward extensor dominance were observed at higher intensities, suggesting a shift toward more efficient torque generation. In contrast, at the ankle, increased coactivation was observed with increasing workload, perhaps serving to stabilize the joint under greater loads. These findings highlight joint-specific neuromuscular adaptations that collectively  support  whole-body  performance  during  cycling.  The  SI  further  revealed  taskspecific changes in flexor-extensor dominance: consistent balance between flexor and extensor activity  at  the  hip,  extensor  dominance  at  the  knee,  and  extensor  dominance  at  the  ankle. Importantly, an observed increase in the SCI with increasing power level suggests that higherintensity cycling evokes a smaller and more coordinated synergy space, indicative of enhanced neuromuscular efficiency and a possible shift toward expert-like control strategies.

Together,  the  CI,  SI,  and  SCI  offer  complementary  perspectives  on  how  the  nervous  system regulates motor complexity, coordination, and joint-specific muscle contributions during dynamic tasks. This study advances our understanding of CNS organization under varying task demands and highlights the potential of synergy- and coactivation-based indices as indicators of neuromuscular function. These findings may inform applications in performance training, injury prevention,  and  rehabilitation  by  supporting  individualized  interventions  aimed  at  improving motor efficiency and joint stability across a wide range of populations.
