tendinitis, iliotibial band syndrome, hip pain, medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, compartment syndrome, numbness of the foot, and metatarsalgia. Injury is caused by a combination of inadequate preparation, inappropriate equipment, poor technique, and overuse. Nonsurgical management may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, ice, a reduction in training intensity, orthotics, night splints, and physical therapy. Injury prevention should be the focus, with particular attention to bicycle fit and alignment, appropriate equipment, proper rider position and pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training.

F romNovember2001throughOctober 2002, approximately 33 million US residents rode a bicycle an average of 6 days a month, for an average of &gt;1 hour on a typical day. 1 The number of bicycling trips taken between 1990 and 1995 doubled following implementation of the National Bicycle and Walking Study ; 2 this trend continues. The increased number of bicyclists has led to increased numbers of associated injuries. 2,3 Traumatic injury occurs as a result of overuse injury from repetitive motion and from unexpected motion. Overuse injury is caused by repetitive loading of bone, joint, and soft tissue with inadequate recovery time. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to injury potential. Intrinsic causes include anatomic alignment of the lower limb, alterations in the normalkinetic chain, and level of fitness. Extrinsic factors include equipment fit, training, and riding technique.

Lower limb injury can be sustained by both the elite cyclist and the casual cyclist.

## Equipment

An understanding of bicycle design, fit, and function is important in treating the patient with an overuse injury. There are multiple variations of bicycle design, depending on the purpose of the bike (eg, road bike versus mountain bike). In addition, several manufacturing materials subsequently can affect the rider. The basic components of a bicycle, however, are maintained across all designs. These components include the frame, seat post, saddle, handlebar, crank arm, and pedals (Figure 1).

Proper fit is essential in reducing the incidence of injury. Bicycle dealers use commercial systems, such as the Fit Kit (Fit Kit Systems, Billings, MT), to fit the bicycle to the rider.

Several standardized measurements are taken and devices used to determine the optimum fit. To maximize muscle power and efficiency, the elite cyclist takes advantage of electromyography to optimize the fit of the frame. With a basic understanding of bicycle mechanics, however, one can effectively determine appropriate fit without a commercial fit system. Frame size, seat height and position, handlebar height and position, crank length, and foot position are the primary fit-related adjustments that must be made for each cyclist.

use, the clearance should be 7.5 to 15 cm. 4 It is essential to select the appropriate frame size because it is the foundation of the bicycle and cannot be adjusted.

## Frame Size and Seat Position

Frame size is determined by evaluating the distance between the crotch of the rider and the top tube of the frame. For on-road use, the distance should be 2.5 to 5 cm; for off-road

Proper seat height and position may be the most important adjustments when fitting a bicycle (Figure 2). Optimal seat height is determined based on inseam, bone length, and leg length. Several studies have indicated that multiplying the inseam measurement by 1.09 provides the optimal seat height for efficient cycling kinematics. 5 Others have found the sum of bone length in the lower extremity to be effective in determining the appropriate seat height. 6 This is determined by measuring the upper leg length from the greater trochanter to the lateral femoral condyle and the lower leg length from the lateral femoral condyle to the tip of the lateral malleolus. The sum of these two values is multi-

## Training and Technique

Stretching is an essential part of the

3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, a plumb line is drawn from the tibial tubercle to the point at which it bisects the axle of the most forward pedal (white line).

Normally, the height of the handlebars is lower than the seat height. The difference depends on the use of the bicycle. For road bicycling, the handlebar typically is 3 to 10 cm lower than the seat. Lower handlebar height allows the cyclist to assume a more aerodynamic position. For off-road biking, the handlebar height is typically not more than 5 cm below the seat height.

Crank length is the distance from the center of the chain ring to the center of the pedal (Figure 1). The crank length determines the diameter of the circle made during a revolution, which affects the amount of hip and knee flexion and extension. A longer crank length provides a suring the length from the greater trochanter to the ground and multiplying the distance by 0.185. 9

Toe clips are plastic or metal devices that attach to the pedals and act as a cage to secure the front part of the foot to the pedal. They increase performance by allowing the quadriceps muscle to contribute to the pedal cycle. Cleats and tight straps also allow recruitment of the hamstrings (Figure 4). Improper positioning of the toe clips can affect the position of the foot on the pedal. It is critical to ensure that the ball of the foot is over the pedal axle. Clip placement too far medially or laterally can result in an adducted or abducted foot position. Toe clips also can cause nerve compression; as a result, most modern bicycles offer clipless pedals.

cycling regimen. There is a tendency in cyclists for shortening of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex and hamstring groups in particular. 10 Even so, stretching is often neglected. Cyclists generally have very strong leg and low back muscles. Relative muscle imbalance is a larger contributor to injury than absolute weakness. Traditionally, quadriceps strengthening with squats has been encouraged. More recently, however, the focus has been on strengthening the gluteal, hamstring, quadriceps, and calf muscles over a range of motion that matches an individual's pedal cycle.

Cleated cycling shoes may be used to improve the mechanical advantage of the rider. The cleats must be properly positioned so that the

## Lower Limb Pain

To properly address lower limb pain in the cyclist, the physician must look not only at the patient but also at the entire cycling regimen, from training and preparation to equipmentandtechnique. It is particularly useful to perform the examination while the patient is in a riding position. Ideally, the examination should be performed during or after a cycling session. Specialized computer biomechanical examination of technique is now available and can be helpful.

## Injury About the Knee

The knee is the most common site of overuse injury in the cyclist, with an estimated 40% to 60% of riders experiencing knee pain. 11,12 Patellofemoral syndrome ('cyclist's knee'), which typically presents as anterior, retropatellar pain, is the most common cause of knee pain in the cyclist. This pain is caused by increased pressure across the patellofemoral joint, poor patellofemoral tracking, or a combination of both. Excessive pressure across the patellofemoral joint is caused by hill climbing, riding in high gears, and a too-slow cadence. 3 The increased

Cadence refers to the number of times the pedal makes a 360° turn each minute. A cyclist should be able to comfortably maintain a cadence of 70 to 80 rpm. A lower cadence rate indicates that too much strain is being applied to the limb, thereby increasing the potential for injury. The incidence of injury may

to patellofemoral syndrome. When the bicycle seat is positioned too low or too far forward, excessive pressure is experienced across the patellofemoral joint. These positions result in excessive flexion of the knee, leading to a more perpendicular vector force across the joint. 10 In addition to proper seat position, adequate training can help minimize the incidence of patellofemoral syndrome. Quadriceps strengthening focused on the VMO, along with stretching of the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemiussoleus complex, may help improve patellofemoral alignment.

pressure results in excessive shear and compression of articular cartilage, leading to chondromalacia.

Patellofemoral malalignment also may cause patellofemoral syndrome as a result of the uneven distribution of pressures across the joint surface (Figure 5). Risk factors for malalignment include high or lateral position of the patella; dysplasia of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) muscle; a large quadriceps angle; inflexibility of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles; and limb deformities, including femoral anteversion, external tibial torsion, and hyperpronated feet with hindfoot valgus. 13,14

Improper bicycle fit also can lead muscle stimulation, which helps establish the desired 1:1 ratio between the VMOandthevastuslateralis (VL) muscles during quadriceps contraction.

Other aids, such as an ultra-light patellofemoral brace or McConnell taping, may be helpful in the recreational cyclist; however, these are too cumbersome and uncomfortable for the competitive cyclist.

Foot and cleat position must be evaluated in the patient with anterior knee pain. Foot hyperpronation with hindfoot valgus causes a functional increase in the quadriceps angle (Q angle), which leads to muscle imbalance and patellofemoral malalignment. Orthoses or wedges, the alter-

Although quadriceps tendinitis maypresent as medial or lateral knee pain, it is commonly lateral in the cyclist. The diagnosis of quadriceps tendinitis may be confused with ITB syndrome or patellofemoral syndrome. Physical examination should readily reveal tenderness over the quadriceps tendon, which aids in diagnosis. Varus or valgus misalignment of the knees can cause excessive stress on the quadriceps tendon; such misalignment is best addressed with orthoses, wedges, and/or cleat position.

dial knee pain in the cyclist are pes anserine bursitis and mediopatellar plica syndrome. Pes anserine bursitis results from repeated friction of the hamstring insertion over the bursa, leading to inflammation and the insidious onset of pain. The patient typically has significant tenderness to palpation over the pes anserine bursa, located 2 to 3 cm below the medial joint line (Figure 6). Hamstring stretching may help to relieve the pressure across the pes anserine bursa. Physical therapy may help in resolving muscle imbalance, and the patient may benefit from application of low-pulse laser and ultrasound. NSAIDs, along with of the patella. 17 The presence of a plica does not necessarily indicate pathology, but with repeated trauma or irritation, the plica can become thickened and fibrotic. Once this occurs, the fibrotic and inelastic plica can cause impingement of the medial femoral condyle and the patella during knee flexion, leading to pain and a popping sensation with each stroke. On examination, the patient typically has tenderness over the medial aspect of the knee near the joint line. In some instances, a thickened plica can be palpated. Valgus knee alignment, internal tibia rotation, and foot hyperpronation can increase the pressure of a medial plica across the medial femoral condyle during cycling.

It is important to recognize and compensate for any of these anatomic variants. The cyclist should cut back on any activities that cause pain. Rest and NSAIDs are typically effective in managing this condition, but in refractory cases, arthroscopic resection of the plica and surrounding synovium may be necessary. 18

## Injury About the Iliotibial Tract and the Hip

The ITB is a thick, fibrous band originating from the iliac crest and extending across the hip and knee to insert onto Gerdy's tubercle on the lateral aspect of the tibia (Figure 8). Repetitive hip and knee flexion and extension cause the ITB to rub over the lateral femoral condyle, creating friction and irritation. This typically occurs when the knee is within 30° of full extension. Greater knee extension is necessary with higher

condition. Rest, NSAIDs, and ice, along with a reduction in training intensity, should be implemented until symptoms resolve. In addition, the cyclist should avoid squats, lunges, and resisted knee extension. Once symptoms resolve, pain-free eccentric strengthening is commenced to address possible underlying weakness caused by overuse.

19 seat position. Increased tension on the ITB may be caused by intrinsic tightness in the band, extrinsic tightness from the gluteus maximus and tensor fascia lata (which inserts on the ITB), and/or from adduction of the knee during hip flexion. With repeated ITB irritation, the cyclist typically reports sharp, stabbing pain in the lateral aspect of the knee.
