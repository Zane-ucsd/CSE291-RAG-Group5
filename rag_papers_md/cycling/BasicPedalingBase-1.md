## Biomechanical	Considerations Of

## Increased	Q-Factor	and	Pedaling	Base

<!-- image -->

Cycling	is	a	pure	example	of	the	kinetic	chain	in	biomechanics,	where	modifying	the	orientation	of	a contact	point	can	produce	a	somewhat	predictable	'chain'	of	events	throughout	the	body	and	other contact	points.

To	illustrate	this	concept,	the	possible	implications	of	a	unilateral	pronation	scenario	are	illustrated below.		A	dropped	arch	at	the	right	pedal	can	effectively	shorten	the	same	leg,	increasing	right	hand pressure	and	causing	the	left-leg	to	appear	'wind-swept'	relative	to	the	bicycle's	midline	-	right-hip drop/left-hip	rise.		The	resulting	increased	left-leg	reach	tends	to	lengthen	the	tensor	fascia	and	increase iliotibial	tract	tension,	which	can	produce	symptoms	from	gliding	over	the	now	more	prominent	(windswept)	lateral	femoral	condyle.

Each	adjustment	to	a	bicycle,	shoes	and/or	cleats	impacts	the	entire	kinetic	chain	when	cycling.		The objective	of	each	quality	bike	fitting	is	to	ensure	that	all	body	parts	are	arranged	in	a	fashion	that	function optimally	in	a	variety	of	conditions .

If	a	person	is	relatively	symmetrical,	with	effective	glute	and	ankle	stability,	owning	relatively	'normal' varus/valgus	knee	angles	we	assume	that	she/he	should	be	capable	of	riding	a	bike	without	knee	pain. The	strength	of	this	assumption	is	strong	so	long	as	a	bike's	contact	points,	shoes	and	cleats	are	adjusted within	the	range	of	an	individual's	biomechanical	needs.

Pedaling	base	is	a	component	of	these	adjustments,	which	I	have	defined	as	the	lateral	distance	between feet	in	the	coronal/frontal	plane	-	adapted	from	'walking	base'	in	gait	analysis.

The	common	protocol	for	determining	appropriate	pedaling	base	is	to	estimate	a	coronal	plane	vertical axis	intersecting	the	center	of	the	femoral	head,	tibial	plateau	and	distal	tibia,	modified	to	accommodate balanced	internal	and	external	tibiofemoral	rotation	(arthrokinematics).

We	can	illustrate	this	alignment	in	the	simplest	terms	by	projecting	a	vertical	laser		(assuming perpendicular	alignment	of	the	bike	relative	to	floor)	along	the	middle-thigh	(upper)	and	roughly	the	2 nd and	3 rd 	MTP's	(toe-knuckles).

Numerous	factors	impact	the	reliability	of	this	approach,	but	practice	supports	a	strong	correlation between	statue	and	pedaling	base.		Big	people	with	large	bones	(not	just	pelvis)	tend	to	appreciate	an increased	lateral-offset	at	the	pedal,	with	a	medial	offset	for	smaller	riders.

## Exceeding	Optimal	Pedaling	Base

Congruency	and	stability	of	the	knee	are	contingent	on	the	relative	function	and	orientation	of	adjacent joints.			In	other	words,	the	ankle,	foot	and	pelvis	are	directly	responsible	for	what	happens	at	the	knee. Symmetrical	pelvic	obliquity	and	rotation	contribute	to	proper	knee	function,	but	may	be	compromised by	improper	ankle	and/or	foot	biomechanics.		Foot	and	ankle	biomechanics	are	impacted	by	many factors,	including	vertical	axis	proximity	to	the	femur	in	the	frontal	plane,	and	may	impact	knee	and	hip function.

Assuming	optimal	pelvis,	ankle	and	foot	orientations	and	function,	bi-lateral	medial	knee	pain	typically accompanies	an	excessively	wide	pedaling	base	with	similar	features	laterally	when	too	narrow.			Of course	there	are	many	exceptions	to	this	rule,	including	people	who	demonstrate	abnormal	kinematics without	symptoms,	but	we	are	speaking	in	general	terms.

Based	on	these	findings,	I	expected	fat	biking	to	host	an	epidemic	of	medial	knee	problems.		In	truth,	the incidence	of	knee	related	issues	for	fat	bike	clients	is	higher,	but	not	sufficient	for	predictive	value.		I expect	this	is	due	to	the	dynamic	features	of	fat	biking	and	reduced	pedaling	torque	necessary	to maintain	traction	riding	off-road	and	in	snowy-conditions.

Regardless	of	symptoms,	compromised	biomechanics	that	can	increase	the	risk	for	injury	or	have cumulative	negative	effects	on	knee	integrity.

Biomechanics	of	a	Wide	Pedaling	Base

Joint	Forces

Flexion	and	compressive	tibiofemoral	loads	are	very	low	when	cycling,	and	patellofemoral	compression has	more	to	do	with	saddle	height/setback	than	pedaling	stance.			Contrary	to	the	medial	condyle	loading accompanying	adduction	moments	in	ground	reaction	force	in	gait,	a	lateral	shift	in	pedal	reaction	force tends	to	distract	the	medial	condyle	and	increase	lateral	compression.

Rotational	stress	is	contingent	on	the	distribution	and	direction	of	femoral	on	tibial	rotation	inherent	to the	combined	open/closed	chain	characteristics	of	pedaling.			Coupled	internal	femoral	and	tibial	rotation patterns	imposed	by	an	excessive	pedaling	base	can	disrupt	menisci	and	Intracapsular	ligament integrities.

Ligament	Forces

Exceeding	the	'normal'	tibiofemoral	valgus	orientation	in	knee	extension	is	a	risk	factor	for	medial ligament	injury	when	riding	a	wide	pedaling	base.

<!-- image -->

The	medial	collateral	ligament	contains	superficial	and	deep	portions	that	are	intimate	to	the	joint capsule	and	medial	meniscus	providing	first-line	resistance	for	knee	adduction.		Imposing	additional torque	on	this	ligament	can	strain/injure	the	ligament,	menisci	or	both.

Less	common	issues	involve	the	meniscofemoral,	anterior	and	posterior	cruciate	ligaments,	though	we'd expect	compromised	integrity	accompanying	excessive	coupled	anterior	tibial	translation	and	internal rotation.

The	patellofemoral,	patellotibial,	and	retinaculum	are	subject	to	increased	tension/strain	relative	to abnormal	valgus	moments,	increasing	the	risk	for	patellar	tracking	errors	and	associated	symptoms.

Posterior	capsular	supporting	ligaments	including	the	oblique	and	arcuate	popliteal	ligaments	are impacted	by	increased	adductor	moments,	though	rarely	symptomatic.

## Muscle	Forces

Muscle	recruitment	is	impacted	by	muscle	tension.		The	force-length	concept	suggests	that	force	is greatest	when	contraction	is	initiated	relative	to	a	muscle's	natural	resting	length,	with	significant reductions	if	activated	in	a	pre-	stretched	or	shortened	condition.

Exceeding	pedaling	base	can	increase	muscle	length/tension	in	the	knee	(and	hip)	adductors	and	internal rotators	accompanied	by	reduced	length/tension	in	knee	(and	hip)	abductors	and	external	rotators

Accompanying	kinematic	features	include	but	are	not	limited	to	increased	valgus	knee	orientation	and internal	tibial	rotation,	impacting	muscles	at	the	pes	anserinus,	semimembranosus,	and	popliteus

The	same	condition	accompanied	by	optimal	foot	and	ankle	stability	might	increase	the	distance	between origin	and	insertion	of	the	biceps	femoris	-	especially	if	this	stability	reduces	valgus	knee	orientation.
