## Runners knee + shin splints

Training plans

Hello I'm 3 weeks away from my first marathon, l've been doing a 15 week prep and everything was going great until about 2 weeks ago I started having some runners knee issues on my longer runs. I've been icing, stretching and rolling as much as I can and It's been improving and when it does flare up it's manageable. But this past week on a training run I started to feel pain in my shin, which I am assuming is shin splints, on the same leg that I get runners knee on. I rested and iced for a couple days after that, but went to go for a run today and my shin instantly started hurting again so I stopped and finished the run on the elliptical.

I have no experience with shin splints so I was wondering if any more experience runners have any advice on how I should approach these next couple weeks leading up to the race? Should I just rest and keep my cardio up on the elliptical or bike?

Open to any suggestions!

Youʼre getting shin splints because you changed your gait to compensate for your knee hurting instead of resting.

Stop running. Youʼre only going to keep hurting yourself.

Shin splints are the worst. So frustrating. No impact cardio for now: swim/elliptical helps a lot and keeps the training up. Don't try to run thru shin splints. They are thr devil.

Any idea if a knee brace of some sort would help with sore knee and shin splints? I have both and am desperate for some relief.

A very similar thing happened before my first marathon. A twisted ankle (non running related) interrupted my training, I got back too quickly and tried to make up for lost workouts by doing too much, too soon, and developed a bad case of shin splints. I was really down about it. The only decent advice is to see a physical therapist, who can tell you exactly what's going on and prescribe exercises to help you. Virtual appointments worked for me and were quicker to schedule.

In the meantime, do whatever cardio and strength work you can without causing too much pain.

Good luck! I know it's frustrating but you can recover from this.

I had shin splint pain last year, and kinesio tape and using YouTube to look up how to use it for shin pain helped immensely. It might not work for you but a $10 solve is probably worth a shot
