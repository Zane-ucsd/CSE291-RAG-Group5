## What is a Return to Running Programme?

This is a method of gradually re-introducing running and impact activity, to allow your body to strengthen and become accustomed to running again without injuring yourself.

## Why do I need to do a Return to Running Programme?

We recommend doing a Return to Running Programme if you have had time out from running related sport as a result of injury, or if you are taking up running as a new sport.

## When am I ready to start my Return to Running Programme?

You should be pain free when fast walking for 30 minutes before starting the Return to Running Programme.

## How do I do my Return to Running Programme?

The Return to Running Programme is a structured way of gradually increasing the amount of running you are doing from week to week. It is important that you are ready both to step up a level when you complete a week without pain, but also to step down a level if you experience any pain or other symptoms.

## What is the structure of my Return to Running Programme?

## Week 1:

Jog 1 minute then walk 1 minute for a total of 30 minutes. Repeat this every other day.

## Week 2:

Jog 2 minutes then walk 1 minute for a total of 30 minutes. Repeat this every other day.

## Week 3:

Jog 4 minutes then walk 1 minute for a total of 30 minutes. Repeat this every other day.

## Week 4:

Jog 9 minutes then walk 1 minute for a total of 30 minutes. Repeat this every other day.

## Week 5:

Jog 15 minutes then walk 1 minute. Repeat every other day.

## Week 6:

Jog 30 minutes continuously. Repeat every other day.

## Week 7 onwards:

You are ready to develop the duration and intensity of your running. We do not recommend increasing the duration or intensity of your sessions by more than 10% per week. For example, if you successfully run for 30 minutes one week, you should run for 33 minutes the next week.

## What if I get pain during my Return to Running Programme?

If you experience a lot of pain during the programme, which does not settle down after reducing the amount of running you are doing, stop running and contact us or your GP . This is particularly important if you have had a stress fracture.

## General tips for running:

-    Run every other day when returning from an injury, to allow your body to adapt to the impact exercise.
-    Have at least one rest day per week.
-    If you want to increase your running distance or time, only increase this by 10% each week. Don't increase both in the same week.
-    Renew your trainers every 300 to 500 miles. Consider having two pairs of trainers 'on the go' at the same time.
-    Vary your training. Combine different speeds, distances and times during your training period. This is called 'cross training' and is a valuable method of reducing injury, by distributing the loads placed upon your body.

## Cross training

Here are some examples of cross training that you may find useful:

-  Swimming
-  Spin classes
-  Pilates
-  Circuits
-  Gym equipment
-  Rowing
