## Always injured runner / triathlete. Anybody graduated to consistently non-injured status?

## ejd\_mil

## Mar 2017

When I started doing triathlon fairly consistently, I was always injured. As in 100% certainty that I was coming into my A race with no / little run training due to an injury.

Over time, I have become better but I am still struggling to go 12 months injury free. The protocol that I follow is: Target a reasonable run volume. Typically around 45 kms / week (just under 30miles), specifically 40k in the winter; 55 in the peak season Hit the run target by running 5 to 6 times / weekMinimize the long runs. Only build some longer runs 4 - 6 weeks before the A raceVirtually no speedwork (Probably have done 3 slightly faster than race pace sessions in the past 15 months. Last one culminated in picking up plantar fascitis 4 months ago)Keep the pace under controlBuild to the run volume on a conservative basis, increase by 2.5kms / week (just under 2 miles)Recover week every 4th week. Typically 25 - 30km (15 to 18 miles)

Despite this conservative approach, I am nursing a strained adductor / psoas. Have taken 2.5 weeks off, but still sore…

For those who were formerly always injured, what winning steps / solutions have you followed to reach the nirvana

## state of non-injured?

PS1: in case relevant, i typically race 70.3. Am a FOP dude (40 - 44 AG) courtesy of reasonable swim and bike times. My run times are between 1.34 and 1.37.

PS2: i saw this thread which I thought was usefulhttp://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch\_Forums \_C1/Triathlon\_Forum\_F1/For\_those\_who\_can't\_run\_(o r\_are\_always\_injured)\_P3002091/? search\_string=always%20injured#p3002091

Previous issues:

- plantar fasciitis
- ITB

Three things have helped me:

1. Strength training 2x / week - mostly single leg work, some core, some plyometrics,
2. Dynamic stretching before all work outs S, B or R leg swings, hip openers, side squats and skipping
3. Weekly message - work out any kinks

Three things commonly recommended and didn't help:

1. Ice
2. Rest
3. Compression or braces

## Good luck!

I have done 30+ triathlons, 3 ironmans, 6 halfs

I've never been healthy for any of them. How stupid is that?

This is the year I change this though. I am 5 weeks away from imtx and 100% healthy (knock on all the wood I can find…)

What's worked:

- stopped using strava for my runs that made me run faster than I should because I like competing
- an extremely extremely pro-active responsive to any tightness in my legs. It's always a precursor to injury.
- the treadmill is my friend now. I look at it as a soft running surface instead of a torture device
- no more huge long runs. I do doubles instead with the first run on the treadmill and second run at lunch outside
- two days off after that long run double day. No exceptions. Consistently running 5 days a week though.

## Good luck!

There are two ways I might look at the same set of things:

1. I am always injured and constantly need to take time off
2. I am never injured and never need to take time off.

Same circumstances, very different interpretations.

I usually go for the never injured interpretation. So far that has worked,

I changed shoes from Hokas to more minimal padding and don't run longer than 1h30 in one run.

It may even just be something outside your workout plan.

For me it was the treadmill. I usually ramp up my training in early January and by Feb or March I'd be be dealing with my knee (Patellafemoral). Because I'm in Canada, a lot of the early training in winter was/is on the treadmill. This year I connected the dots - it wasn't the volume so much as how I did that volume - specifically a cheap treadmill that has a bit too much cushion. What I suspect is that I'm overextending relative to pavement.

This year, I've done it almost all outside, even in deep freeze or blizzard and I'm able to handle more volume than I ever have. Now that I've gotten my base, I can even go back and do once a week on the treadmill without risking it all. Though now when I do go to the treadmill I both check that it's a good one and I make sure to change my incline or pace at least 1x per minute (so I'm not doing repetitive kms over and over)

For me it was keep trying things until something works. Gradually ramping up is a good idea. I tried dynamic stretching as my issue was recurrent calf strains. Then I tried strengthening calf muscles with heel dips. In the end the static stretching I did when I was in my teens worked. And a physio showed me how to do a soleus stretch with my knee bent in addition to a regular achilles stretch with knee straight. The other thing is if something hurts now I back off rather than trying to 'train through it' My shoulder is sore now because I wiped out on it running outside on an icy day rather than using the treadmill.

I started this thread 4 years ago as I struggled with getting injured.

## http://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch\_Forums \_C1/Triathlon\_Forum\_F1/Injured\_Again%2C\_Input\_nee ded\_P4464335/?search\_string=injur#p4464335

I didn't think any of those people were right at the time, but reading back on it now… they definitely were.

It wasn't until this past summer that things finally started clicking. What worked for me (and this took years to develop and figure out):

- Run slow at a conversational pace Almost all runs are in zone 1/ low zone 2 hr. Let the pace be whatever it is. This was the biggest thing that made everything click.
- softer surfaces. I run on the treadmill most of time and try to find trails to run on. I do my best to avoid asphalt/concrete.
- running form. Found someone who knew proper running form and showed me what I was doing wrong and how to fix it.
- massage… i get a massage every other week
- must address any little tweaks or tightness as soon as they happen (foam roll, stretch)

I'm now 9+ months without having to take a day off due to injury. Longest streak I've ever had since being in this sport.
