in their careers most runners find themselves injured,  in  pain,  or  even  laid  off.  Running Injuries:  How  to  Prevent  and  Overcome Them (3rd ed.) by Tim Noakes and Stephen Granger was written from the point of view that runners need to understand not only the cause of their injury, but also how to obtain the best possible treatment for it. Moreover, since avoiding injuries is always better than being forced to treat them, a special focus is on injury prevention.

The authors are extremely well qualified to deal with the subject. Noakes is not only a professor of exercise and sports science at

the University of Cape Town, Director of the Medical  Research  Council/UCT  Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine at the Sports Science Institute of South Africa,  and  a  practising  consultant  at  the UCT Sports Injuries Clinic, but he is also an avid runner, who has run over 70 marathons and ultra-marathons. His book Lore of Running is widely regarded internationally as the most definitive guide for runners and sports scientists.

Granger is a former competitive road and cross-country runner and a freelance writer and photographer. He has served as provincial  road  running  referee,  convener  of  the Western  Province  road  running  selectors, and  technical  director  for  the  1996  World Cross-Country Championships in  Cape Town.

Running Injuries comprises seven chapters:

In  Chapter  1,  'New  insights  into  running injuries,'  a  distinction  is  made  between extrinsic an intrinsic sports injuries. Extrinsic sports injuries result from the application of a single,  irresistible  force  to  the  body,  which causes the immediate onset of pain and disability.  They  occur  especially  in  contact  or collision-type sports. Intrinsic injuries do not originate  from  forces  outside  the  body  and their onset is typically gradual. These injuries are  very  often  found  in  long-distance  runners.

The  unique  feature  of  running  injuries  is that  they  have  an  identifiable  and  treatable cause. The authors emphasise that until that cause is rectified, the conventional approach - rest, drugs, injections, and surgery - is an expensive  waste  of  time.  The  first  one  to conclude  this  in  the  1970s  was  marathonrunning  cardiologist  George  Sheehan.  He found  out  that  treatment  of  running  injury must take into account every possible contributory factor - the genetics, unique physiology  and  biomechanics  of  the  individual, the environment (specifically the running surface), the type of shoe that is worn, and the training. This implies that a holistic view must be adopted and any or all of these factors must be corrected if an injury is to be prevented or cured.

Against this background, the authors' aim is to provide runners with 1) an understanding of how their own genetic predispositions make them vulnerable to injury, 2) the means to  remain  injury-free,  and  3)  the  hope  of returning to their sport in the shortest possible time.

Chapter  2,  'Understanding  the  body,' deals with the basic principles of the mechanics  of  running,  the  knowledge  of which is essential to understanding why runners become injured. This includes: the principles of the ideal running stride, the role of the ankle as a universal joint, the normal or ideal running gait, structural foot deficiencies (the rigid and immobile 'clunk' foot and the hypermobile  foot  versus  the  normal  foot), biomechanical  structure  and  shoe  design, and other structural deficiencies (bow legs, a quadriceps angle greater than 16…).

In  Chapter  3,  'Understanding  the  mind,' the  psychological  factors  that  determine  a runner's  response  to  injury  are  considered. Here, the point is made that the tools, e. g. the shoes and the orthotics, may not be sufficient to cure many runners. Some conventional remedies are useless as some runners can  never  heal  because  their  problem  may be  more  a  mental  than  a  physical  one,  a condition for which the authors have coined the term 'excessive pronation of the brain.' It is also shown that certain personal factors should be considered when treating injuries. These are:

- ¥ the  desire  to  be  in  control  (injured  runners  whose  wish  is  to  be  in  control  of their  treatment  require  little  more  than simple  advice,  whereas  injured  runners who  wish  to  be  controlled  require  very precise and detailed instructions),
- ¥ the level of self-esteem (e. g. athletes with a  low  self-confidence  often  require  the doctor to take charge of their treatment),

- ¥ the speed of decision-making (e. g. people who take a long time to consider all the possible consequences of their decisions should consult more patient physicians who better understand their needs),
- ¥ the  degree  of  extroversion-introversion (introverted persons become even more so  when  injured,  whereas  extroverted persons  may  use  denial  and  joking  to avoid facing the reality of the injury), and
- ¥ interpersonal expressiveness (if, for example, an injured person's expressiveness  is  dominated  by  the  intellectual instead  of  the  emotional  function,  a structured treatment protocol rather than understanding  and  commisteration  is required).

Understanding  the  psychology  of  injury helps to understand why athletes respond to injuries in their own peculiar way. By understanding  why  one  responds  as  one  does, one gains a better insight into one's psychological  make-up  and  the  type  of  medical approach  that  will  most  likely  be  helpful  to get over the injury.

Chapter  4,  'Preventing  running  injuries,' begins  with  a  list of  those  factors  that increase the risk of injury, for example:

- ¥ gender  (women  have  a  broader  hip structure  than  men  and  are  thus  more likely  to  have  biomechanical  abnormalities in the lower limbs that predispose to injury),
- ¥ anatomical abnormalities,
- ¥ heavy mass,
- ¥ inappropriate shoes,
- ¥ training errors,
- ¥ inflexibility,
- ¥ muscle imbalance,
- ¥ failure to warm up.

Subsequently this chapter focuses on several  key  strategies  for  preventing  running injuries:  choosing  appropriate  shoes,  using sound  training  methods,  stretching  to  promote muscle flexibility, exercising to strengthen the muscles and warming up.

Chapter 4 concludes with a simple checklist of points for avoiding injuries, including:

- ¥ Run on forgiving surfaces.
- ¥ Warm  up  beforehand  (and  cool  down afterwards).
- ¥ Stretch regularly.
- ¥ Do muscle-strengthening exercises.
- ¥ Alternate hard and easy training days.
- ¥ Race  in  moderation  and  only  when injury-free.
- ¥ Maintain a daily running logbook.
- ¥ Monitor your running shoes.

In  Chapter  5,  'The  ten  laws  of  running injuries,' the authors once again stress that it is absolutely crucial to understand the reason for a running injury and that it serves no purpose to diagnose the injury correctly if no attention  is  paid  to  the  cause.  If  nothing  is done to eliminate the cause of the injury, the injury  is  quite  likely  to  recur,  possibly  more serious  than  before.  Chapter  5  is  therefore intended  to  allow  injured  runners  to  reflect on why their injury occurred. For this reflection  the  consideration  of  the  following  'ten laws of running injuries' may be helpful:

1. Running  injuries  are  not  a  act  of  God. (Instead  they  result  from  the  interaction of the athlete's genetic structure with the environment through training methods.)
2. Each  injury  progresses  through  four grades.  (Pain  after  exercise,  discomfort during  exercise,  pain  during  exercise, pain  that  prevents  any  attempts  at  running)
3. Each injury indicates a breakdown point. (This  law  simply  emphasises  that  once an  injury has  occurred,  it  is  time  to analyse why the injury happened.)
4. Most true running injuries are curable.
5. Sophisticated methods are seldom necessary to diagnose injury.
6. Treat the cause, not the effect.
7. Complete rest is seldom the most appropriate treatment.
8. Never  accept  as  final  the  advice  of  a non-runner (medical doctor or other).
9. Avoid surgery.
10. There  is  little  evidence  that  recreational running causes osteoarthritis.

At  the  end  of  the  chapter,  the  authors underline once more the importance of the psychological aspect: 'Indeed, it is possible that 60% of the caregiver's success is due to  an  ability  to  understand  what  the  injury means  to  the  patient,  the  fears  that  the injury  engenders,  and  how  best  to  allay those fears. In this approach the caregiver needs  to  understand  the  patient's  psyche and why the patient came to have the injury being examined.'

Chapter  6,  'Bones  and  muscles:  a  discussion  of  non-site  specific  injuries,'  contains a general account of certain types of bone  and  muscle  injuries  which  occur  at different  sites  on  the  musculoskeletal  system.  While  the  site  of  the  injury  may  vary, the  diagnosis,  cause  and  treatment  are often the same. This chapter also provides a background to the discussion of site-specific injuries in the chapter 7.

The two common bone injuries in runners are  stress  fractures  and  (tibial  and  fibular) bone  strain.  Muscle  injuries  in  runners  fall into four categories:

1. delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS),
2. acute (sudden) muscle tears,
3. chronic (insiduous) muscle tears, and
4. muscle cramps.

For  each  of  these  injuries  diagnosis, cause, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation are discussed. Although not an injury to the musculo-skeletal system, the stitch is dealt with at the end of this chapter.

Chapter  7,  'A  troubleshooter's  guide  to site-specific  injuries,'  is  with  its  75  pages also the book's longest chapter. This chapter  might  also  attract  the  greatest  interest among  injured  runners  because  in  it  the diagnosis, causes, and treatment methods of  approximately  40  running  injuries  are presented  and  discussed.  These  injuries concern the following parts of the body:

- ¥ the back
- ¥ the buttocks,
- ¥ the hip, pelvis, and groin,
- ¥ the upper leg,
- ¥ the knee,
- ¥ the lower leg,
- ¥ the tendons,
- ¥ the ankle, and
- ¥ the foot.

The  book  concludes  with  a  diagnostic chart, which makes it easy to find information on specific injuries, and a glossary.

What  sets  Noakes'  and  Granger's  book apart from the numerous other books about injuries  is  that  every  page  reflects  genuine practical  experience.  In  accordance  with the eighth  law  of running  injuries  (see above), runners are always among the best sources  of  information  about  what  works and what doesn't work in the treatment of their  injuries.  For  this  reason,  the  text  is interspersed  with  personal  accounts  from runners  dealing  with  and  trying  to  prevent injuries. In each case these are followed by a comment from the authors, who put the individual  experiences  into  a  greater  perspective.

Running  Injuries is  an  extremely  good example of how to translate medical knowledge  into  very  readable  and  convincing practical  information.  Runners  reading  this book  will  see  in  every  sentence  that  the authors are both experts and runners themselves.  Importantly, they will feel that their problems  are  taken  seriously  and  that  the advice given can be relied upon.

Without  doubt, Running  Injuries should be a part of every runner's library.
