## Basic Return to Running Guideline

## Ideal for runners returning from being off running 4+ weeks

- This program is designed for end stage rehabilitation return to running in order to reacclimatize tissue to loads associated with running without exceeding the load capacity of the runner's musculoskeletal system.
- The clinician should use their own clinical judgment to determine when it is safe to begin and is encouraged to modify the below hop and run progressions to tailor the program to the individual.
- Factors to consider when adjusting running volume: Injury severity, time away from running, pre-injury fitness level, running experience, running mechanics (Forefoot strike → Achilles/Calf; Overstriding → PF joint).
- ROM: full, pain-free joint ROM, symmetrical with the uninvolved limb

Criteria to initiate jumping program

- Strength: Strength: MMT 5/5 OR Isokinetic or hand held dynamometry testing  with 80% limb symmetry index for involved muscle groups and proximal muscle groups
- 20 heel touches on 8 inch step with good mechanics
- Weight bearing: normalized walking gait mechanics

## Criteria to initiate running progression

## Guidelines for progression of running program

- Met the above criteria for initiating jumping program.
- Hopping drills with appropriate landing mechanics and without increased pain or swelling.
- Able to tolerate 200-250 foot contacts (equivalent to 1/3 mile of running).
- Able to walk 30 minutes without pain and normalized gait.
- Audible rhythmic strike patterns and no gross visual compensation with brief (10-20 seconds) run in the clinic.
-  A dynamic warm-up should be performed for 5-10 minutes before the workout.
-  The run is to be performed at comfortable run effort.
-  The runner is to take at least one day off in between running days.
-  The runner can progress to the next phase once they are able to complete 6 reps of the run time without increased pain or swelling.
- Do not progress phases if any one of the following occurs: sharp pain during run, pain that worsens as patient continues running, pain is so severe that it causes patient to alter gait
- After completion of Phase 5, increase weekly mileage by 10-30%.
- Once back to 50-60% of runner's pre-injury weekly mileage, gradually increase speed and introduce hills.
- Once back to 75-80% of runner's pre-injury weekly mileage, can resume normal training.
-  To be completed by the physical therapist taking into account the runner/injury and mileage progression of 10-30% per week.
